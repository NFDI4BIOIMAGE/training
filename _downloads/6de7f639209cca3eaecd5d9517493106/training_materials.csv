[Workshop] FAIR data handling for microscopy: Structured metadata annotation in OMERO,"Fuchs, Vanessa Aphaia Fiona, Schmidt, Christian, Boissonnet, Tom","['https://zenodo.org/records/11109616', 'https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11109616']","research data management, omero",cc-by-4.0,"Description
Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:

Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining
Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO

The target group for this workshop
This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Who are the trainers (see trainer description below for more details)

Dr. Vanessa Fuchs (NFDI4BIOIMAGE Data Steward, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich-Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich-Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg)

OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO.
