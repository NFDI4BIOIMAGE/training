Bioimaging has now entered the era of big data with faster than ever development of complex microscopy technologies leading to increasingly complex datasets. This enormous increase in data size and informational complexity within those datasets has brought with it several difficulties in terms of common and harmonized data handling, analysis and management practices, which are currently hampering the full potential of image data being realized. Here we outline a wide range of efforts and solutions currently being developed by the microscopy community to address these challenges on the path towards FAIR bioimage data. We also highlight how different actors in the microscopy ecosystem are working together, creating synergies that develop new approaches, and how research infrastructures, such as Euro-BioImaging, are fostering these interactions to shape the field.&nbsp;

Coordinated collaboration is essential to realize the added value of and infrastructure requirements for global image data sharing in the life sciences. In this White Paper, we take a first step at presenting some of the most common use cases as well as critical/emerging use cases of (including the use of artificial intelligence for) biological and medical image data, which would benefit tremendously from better frameworks for sharing (including technical, resourcing, legal, and ethical aspects).
