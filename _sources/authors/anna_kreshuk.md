Coordinated collaboration is essential to realize the added value of and infrastructure requirements for global image data sharing in the life sciences. In this White Paper, we take a first step at presenting some of the most common use cases as well as critical/emerging use cases of (including the use of artificial intelligence for) biological and medical image data, which would benefit tremendously from better frameworks for sharing (including technical, resourcing, legal, and ethical aspects).

Bioimage analysis (BIA), a crucial discipline in biological research, overcomes the limitations of subjective analysis in microscopy through the creation and application of quantitative and reproducible methods. The establishment of dedicated BIA support within academic institutions is vital to improving research quality and efficiency and can significantly advance scientific discovery. However, a lack of training resources, limited career paths and insufficient recognition of the contributions made by bioimage analysts prevent the full realization of this potential. This Perspective – the result of the recent The Company of Biologists Workshop ‘Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis’, which aimed to summarize the global BIA landscape, categorize obstacles and offer possible solutions – proposes strategies to bring about a cultural shift towards recognizing the value of BIA by standardizing tools, improving training and encouraging formal credit for contributions
