Bioimaging has now entered the era of big data with faster than ever development of complex microscopy technologies leading to increasingly complex datasets. This enormous increase in data size and informational complexity within those datasets has brought with it several difficulties in terms of common and harmonized data handling, analysis and management practices, which are currently hampering the full potential of image data being realized. Here we outline a wide range of efforts and solutions currently being developed by the microscopy community to address these challenges on the path towards FAIR bioimage data. We also highlight how different actors in the microscopy ecosystem are working together, creating synergies that develop new approaches, and how research infrastructures, such as Euro-BioImaging, are fostering these interactions to shape the field.&nbsp;

Abstract:
European Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS-RIs), one of the five major RI Science Clusters in Europe, were established to provide access to cutting-edge technologies to the scientific community. Individually, and collectively as the LS-RI cluster, they contribute to the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), under the aegis of the EOSC Federation. They are actively involved in the design and implementation of Competence Centres (CCs). These aim to increase the accessibility of domain-specific knowledge and tools, enhance interoperability, facilitate sharing and harmonisation of procedures, and promote Open Science and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices. In this paper, we report a landscape mapping of the existing resources that formed the basis for the construction of CCs. We describe the possible design of CCs and their articulation with the LS-RIs. We focus on community-based ideas and recommendations to increase the potential of CCs to address long-standing challenges in sustainability, governance, scalability, and interoperability of Open Science within EOSC and the European Research Area (ERA) more generally.This paper provides a description of the nascent LS CCs, built following a survey of needs and services of existing LS-RI communities. When fully implemented, the LS CCs will serve as dynamic hubs to foster innovation, contribute to the EOSC&rsquo;s future FAIR web of data, and support ongoing developments of the EOSC Federation. They will act as drivers of collaborative and impactful LS research in Europe and beyond. We explore the underlying challenges, and propose solutions, to ensure that the establishment of CCs will add value to the LS RI community, and to the EOSC, in a sustainable way.

"Be SURE - Be SUstainable REcommendations"The main goals and challenges for the Life Science (LS) communities in the Open Science framework are to increase reuse and sustainability of data resources, software tools, and workflows, especially in large-scale data-driven research and computational analyses. Here, we present key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating and establishing sustainable LS resources based on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary work done within the EOSC-Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences) consortium. Bringing together 13 European LS Research Infrastructures (RIs), it has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational, technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC-Life provides a model for sustainable FAIR data management, including solutions for sensitive- and industry-related resources, by means of cross-disciplinary training and best practices sharing. Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.IN PRESS EMBO Journal:&nbsp;https://www.embopress.org/journal/14602075&nbsp;AVAILABLE SOON at : https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2023115008&nbsp;
