Data and access to it are central to each NFDI consortium. However, moving data&nbsp;around is often impractical&mdash;it may be too large, sensitive, or restricted by agreements&nbsp;with, e.g., the funding provider, and copying introduces duplication, versioning issues,&nbsp;and loss of provenance. Rather than bringing data to the researcher, a Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) approach can offer researchers interactive, high-performance access in a secure and efficient manner. Driven by the need for seamless workflows and&nbsp;efficient data handling in NFDI4BIOIMAGE, we present a DaaS approach that is&nbsp;broadly applicable across NFDI. It supports diverse use cases, such as standardized&nbsp;virtual training environments for distributed participants (like required in DataPLANT), remote visualization of large-scale HPC datasets, and secure access to sensitive&nbsp;data (BERD)&mdash;all without the overhead of local machine setup and maintenance.
