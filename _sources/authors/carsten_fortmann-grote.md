The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

## Integration of Bioimage and *Omics data resources

Carsten Fortmann-Grote, Mariana Meireles

Published 2025-02-03



This Poster was presented at the 2025 All Hands Meeting of the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Consortium. It presents the current state of data integration activities at the MPI for Evolutionary Biology. Various data and metadata resources such as the internal image data repository OMERO and the Electronic Lab Notebook System OpenBIS are converted into a RDF Knowledge Graph utilizing a R2RML mapping scheme based on the Ontop-VKG framework. The materialized Knowledge Graph is then served via the QLever SPARQL endpoint and user interface. A graphical query editor (SPARNatural) assists users with no SPARQL knowledge in constructing their queries by selecting triple elements from dropdown menus and other widgets.&nbsp;We also present a benchmark comparison of query response times on 10 selected SPARQL queries run against three different endpoint/triplestore implementations.&nbsp;
