Oral presentation, 32nd MoMAN &quot;From Molecules to Man&quot; Seminar, Ulm, online. Monday February 6th, 2023

Abstract:

Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects. To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats, data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.

In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification. German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities, research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice. &nbsp;

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

omero-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data viewing.
OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.
The three files in this Zenodo Record are all the same poster saved in different format all with high resolution images.

This is a Key-Value pair template used for the annotation of datasets in OMERO. It is tailored for a research study (PERIKLES project) on the biocompatibility of newly designed biomaterials out of pericardial tissue for cardiovascular substitutes (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0182672) conducted in the research department of Cardiac Surgery at the Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden . A corresponding public example dataset is used in the publication "Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users" and is available here
(https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=dataset-1557).
The template is based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015) and it was developed during the PoL-Bio-Image Analysis Symposium in Dresden Aug 28th- Sept 1th 2023.&nbsp;
With this template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate a dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).
How to use:
select and copy the data range containing Keys and Values
open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in column B1
type in A1 'dataset'
insert in A2 the exact name of the dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv- (comma seperated values) file format

Example can be seen in sheet 1 'csv import'. Important note; the code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might not be able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft Office versions (e.g. MS Office 2016).&nbsp;
Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of decimal delimiter.

Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing, researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.

Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) aims to establish a sustained, cross-disciplinary research data management (RDM) infrastructure that enables researchers to handle FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data. While&nbsp;FAIR principles have been&nbsp;adopted by funders, policymakers, and publishers, their practical implementation remains an ongoing effort. In the field of bio-imaging, harmonization of&nbsp;data formats, metadata ontologies, and open data repositories is necessary&nbsp;to achieve FAIR data.&nbsp;The NFDI4BIOIMAGE was established&nbsp;to address these issues and&nbsp;develop tools and best practices to facilitate FAIR microscopy and image analysis data in alignment with international community activities. The&nbsp;consortium operates through its Data Stewards team to provide expertise and direct support to help overcome RDM challenges. The three Helmholtz Centers in NFDI4BIOIMAGE aim to collaborate closely with other centers and initiatives, such as HMC, Helmholtz AI, and HIP. Here we present NFDI4BIOIMAGE&rsquo;s work and its significance for research in Helmholtz and beyond

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions

Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024, at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)
Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.
Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation
Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji
Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks

Description
Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:

Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining
Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO

The target group for this workshop
This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.

Workshop Abstract:
Effective Research Data Management (RDM) requires collaboration between infrastructure providers, support units, and domain-specific experts across scientific disciplines. Microscopy, or bioimaging, is a widely used technology at universities and research institutions, generating large, multi-dimensional datasets. Scientists now routinely produce microscopy data using advanced imaging modalities, often through centrally-provided instruments maintained by core facilities.
Bioimaging data management presents unique challenges: files are often large (e.g., 15+ GB for whole slide images), come in various proprietary formats, and are accessed frequently for viewing as well as for complex image processing and analysis workflows. Collaboration between experimenters, clinicians, group leaders, core facility staff, and image analysts adds to the complexity, increasing the risk of data fragmentation and metadata loss.
The DFG-funded project I3D:bio and the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE, part of Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), are addressing these challenges by developing solutions and best practices for managing large, complex microscopy datasets. This workshop introduces the challenges of bioimaging RDM to institutional support personnel, including, for example, library staff, IT departments, and data stewards. Participants will explore the bioimaging RDM system OMERO, and apply structured metadata annotation and object-oriented data organization to a simple training dataset. OMERO offers centralized, secure access to data, allowing collaboration and reducing the data fragementation risk. Moreover, participants will experience the benefits of OME-Zarr, a chunked open file format designed for FAIR data sharing and remote access. OME-Zarr enables streaming of large, N-dimensional array-typed data over the Internet without the need to download whole files. An expanding toolbox for leveraging OME-Zarr for bioimaging data renders this file type a promising candidate for a standard file format suitable for use in FAIR Digital Object (FDO) implementations for microscopy data. OME-Zarr has become a pillar for imaging data sharing in two bioimaging-specific data repositories, i.e., the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the BioImage Archive (BIA). The team of Data Stewards from both abovenmentioned projects help researchers and research support staff to manage und publish bioimaging data.
By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained hands-on experience with bioimaging data and will be aware of support resources like the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Help Desk for addressing specific local use cases. Our goal is to promote collaboration across disciplines to effectively manage complex bioimaging data in compliance with the FAIR principles.
