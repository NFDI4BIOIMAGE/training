Bioimaging has transformed our understanding of biological processes, yet extracting&nbsp;meaningful information from complex datasets remains a challenge, particularly for&nbsp;early career scientists. This paper proposes a simplified, systematic approach to&nbsp;bioimage analysis, focusing on categorizing commonly observed structures and&nbsp;shapes, and providing relevant analysis methods. Our approach includes illustrative&nbsp;examples and a visual flowchart, enabling researchers to define analysis objectives&nbsp;clearly. By understanding the diversity of bioimage structures and aligning them with&nbsp;appropriate analysis approaches, the framework empowers researchers to navigate&nbsp;bioimage datasets more efficiently. It also aims to foster a common language between&nbsp;researchers and analysts, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and facilitating&nbsp;effective communication.
