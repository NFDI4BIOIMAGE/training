Euro-BioImaging has developed a Data Management Plan (DMP) template with questions tailored to bioimaging research projects. Outlining data management practices in this way ensures traceability of project data, allowing for a continuous and unambiguous flow of information throughout the research project. This template can be used to satisfy the requirement to submit a DMP to certain funders. Regardless of the funder, Euro-BioImaging users are encouraged to provide a DMP and can use this template accordingly.&nbsp;
This DMP template is available as a fillable PDF with further instructions and sample responses available by hovering over the fillable fields.&nbsp;

## Image Repository Decision Tree - Where do I deposit my imaging data

Depositing data in quality data repositories is one crucial step towards FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data. Accordingly, Euro-BioImaging strongly encourages sharing scientific imaging data in established, thematic repositories.&nbsp;
To guide you in the selection of appropriate repositories, we have created an overview of available repositories for different types of image data, including their scope and requirements. This decision tree guides you through questions about your data and directs you to the correct repository, and/or provides instructions for further processing to meet the critera of the repositories.&nbsp;
Three seperate trees are provided for different classes of imaging data: open bioimage data, preclinical data, and human imaging data. These versions with three trees can be used for web-view. Update: also the editable versions in powerpoint format (.pptx) are now provided. Please be aware that opening the versions with another program might lead to shifted formatting.
Update: we now also provide ready-to-print versions designed to be printed on A3 format. One page shows the open bioimaging data tree and one page combines the preclinical and human imaging data trees. Also the editable versions of these are provided.

EVOLVE Mentoring Masterclasses
Description:This series captures the class guides of the 2025 masterclasses from Euro‑BioImaging's EVOLVE Mentoring Program.
Included Masterclasses:

Peter O&rsquo;Toole &ndash; &ldquo;Entrepreneurship &amp; Leadership in Imaging Core Facilities&rdquo;&nbsp;Peter O&rsquo;Toole, President of the Royal Microscopical Society and Director of the Bioscience Technology Facility (University of York), kicks off the series with a deep dive into entrepreneurial leadership. He highlights how to balance science, business, and technology, emphasizing stakeholder engagement, staff investment, cross-training, and using social media to boost visibility and unlock funding.
Ilaria Testa &ndash; &ldquo;Interdisciplinary Science, SMART Microscopy &amp; Team Building&rdquo;&nbsp;Professor Ilaria Testa (SciLifeLab &amp; KTH) reflects on her transition from physics to super-resolution microscopy and team leadership. Her session underscores the power of crossing disciplinary boundaries, mentorship, and innovation in live-cell imaging .
Daphna Link‑Sourani &ndash; &ldquo;Leadership, Facility Management &amp; Work‑Life Balance&rdquo;&nbsp;Dr. Daphna Link‑Sourani (Technion Human MRI Research Center) challenges hierarchical notions of leadership, advocating instead for integrity, empathy, and strategic vision. She draws on her experience establishing an MRI facility to discuss crisis management, user engagement, and balancing career demands.
Muriel Mari &ndash; &ldquo;Women in Science: Normalizing, Supporting &amp; Leading"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Muriel Mari (Aarhus University) leads a powerful reflection on gender equity in science. Her masterclass goes beyond barriers&mdash;focusing on cultural shifts, inclusive leadership, and redefining success. She encourages institutions and individuals alike to move from tokenism to transformative support, and to recognize the diverse paths women take in STEM.
Sylvia E. Le D&eacute;v&eacute;dec &ndash; &ldquo;Image Data Management &amp; FAIR Core Facilities&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Sylvia Le D&eacute;v&eacute;dec (Leiden University) discusses how to integrate FAIR data principles in imaging core facilities. Drawing on her experience with high-content imaging and Open Science advocacy, she outlines actionable steps toward sustainable, reusable, and accessible data workflows.

Why Archive These Sessions?These masterclasses offer invaluable insights for core facility managers, imaging scientists, and team leaders in life sciences. They blend hands-on leadership strategies, technical facility growth advice, and real-world experience&mdash;making them essential viewing for professionals and institutions aiming to build sustainable, people-centred imaging infrastructures.

&nbsp;This workshop was held at the ELMI Meeting 2025 in Heidelberg (https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/elmi2025/).
Abstract
FAIR 101 - Navigating FAIR data from principles to practice
Isabel Kemmer, Euro-BioImaging ERIC
This workshop will introduce the FAIR principles in the context of bioimaging data. Designed for researchers working across scales and technologies of biological and biomedical imaging, the session will address the unique challenges posed by complex, multidimensional bioimaging datasets. With the aim of providing simple yet impactful steps for a smooth start to the FAIR journey we will explore the features and benefits of FAIR data through interactive exercises and discussions - from metadata annotation and data management planning to repository selection. By the end of the workshop, you will feel more confident in applying the FAIR concepts and be prepared to improve your imaging workflows to make your precious data even more valuable.
