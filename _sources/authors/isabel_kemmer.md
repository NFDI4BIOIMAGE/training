Bioimaging has now entered the era of big data with faster than ever development of complex microscopy technologies leading to increasingly complex datasets. This enormous increase in data size and informational complexity within those datasets has brought with it several difficulties in terms of common and harmonized data handling, analysis and management practices, which are currently hampering the full potential of image data being realized. Here we outline a wide range of efforts and solutions currently being developed by the microscopy community to address these challenges on the path towards FAIR bioimage data. We also highlight how different actors in the microscopy ecosystem are working together, creating synergies that develop new approaches, and how research infrastructures, such as Euro-BioImaging, are fostering these interactions to shape the field.&nbsp;

## Euro-BioImaging's Template for Research Data Management Plans

Euro-BioImaging has developed a Data Management Plan (DMP) template with questions tailored to bioimaging research projects. Outlining data management practices in this way ensures traceability of project data, allowing for a continuous and unambiguous flow of information throughout the research project. This template can be used to satisfy the requirement to submit a DMP to certain funders. Regardless of the funder, Euro-BioImaging users are encouraged to provide a DMP and can use this template accordingly.&nbsp;
This DMP template is available as a fillable PDF with further instructions and sample responses available by hovering over the fillable fields.&nbsp;

Depositing data in quality data repositories is one crucial step towards FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data. Accordingly, Euro-BioImaging strongly encourages sharing scientific imaging data in established, thematic repositories.&nbsp;
To guide you in the selection of appropriate repositories, we have created an overview of available repositories for different types of image data, including their scope and requirements. This decision tree guides you through questions about your data and directs you to the correct repository, and/or provides instructions for further processing to meet the critera of the repositories.&nbsp;
Three seperate trees are provided for different classes of imaging data: open bioimage data, preclinical data, and human imaging data.&nbsp;
