Together with the molecular knowledge of genes and proteins, biological images promise to significantly enhance the scientific understanding of complex cellular systems and to advance predictive and personalized therapeutic products for human health. For this potential to be realized, quality-assured image data must be shared among labs at a global scale to be compared, pooled, and reanalyzed, thus unleashing untold potential beyond the original purpose for which the data was generated.

## RDF as a bridge to domain-platforms like OMERO, or There and back again.

Josh Moore, Andra Waagmeester, Kristina Hettne, Katherine Wolstencroft, Susanne Kunis

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However, just a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the development of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes it possible to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot immediately be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering the benefit of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

## Towards open and standardised imaging data: an introduction to Bio-Formats, OME-TIFF, and OME-Zarr

Microscopy and bioimaging technologies are fundamental tools for exploring biological systems, generating large, multidimensional datasets rich in experimental detail. However, the bioimaging community has historically faced major challenges around data handling: vendor-specific proprietary formats, fragmented metadata storage, and increasingly large dataset sizes that outstrip traditional storage and computing solutions.
In this webinar, key open technologies developed by the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) to address these challenges were presented. Specifically, the Bio-Formats library for accessing diverse proprietary file formats, the OME-TIFF standard for archival data storage, and the OME-Zarr format for cloud-native, scalable bioimaging workflows were presented.

## Zarr - A Cloud-Optimized Storage for Interactive Access of Large Arrays

Josh Moore, Susanne Kunis

Published 2023-09-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



For decades, the sharing of large N-dimensional datasets has posed issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or down-sampled representations on the fly. Now, a cloud-native chunked format easing this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The format — Zarr — is potentially of interest for other consortia and sections of NFDI.

## [ELMI2025] The Road to OME-Zarr 1.0

Josh Moore

Presented at https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/elmi2025/
&nbsp;
Abstract
For over 20 years, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) has developed tools and specifications to support bioimaging data sharing. Technologies such as Bio-Formats, OMERO, and OME-TIFF have helped researchers manage the growing size, complexity, and acquisition rates of imaging datasets. However, with increasing mandates for research data management, such as the Nelson memo in the United States, and the shift toward cloud-native workflows, the bioimaging community faces new challenges in ensuring scalable and FAIR data infrastructure.
In 2024, following expanding community engagement, the focus of the Next-Generation File Format (NGFF) community was on building consensus around a Request for Comments (RFC) process. This collaborative effort has laid the foundation for future refinements and wider adoption. In parallel, we hosted the &ldquo;OME2024 NGFF Challenge," bringing together over the course of just four months hundreds of terabytes of data in a first prototype of federated image hosting, showcasing the power of OME-Zarr for handling large-scale, distributed datasets.
In 2025, we are set to take a major step toward a stable FAIR solution with OME-Zarr 1.0. This milestone marks a crucial phase towards an international standard, providing an open, cloud-optimized, and scalable solution for handling terabyte- and petabyte-scale imaging data. The 1.0 release will introduce long-awaited transforms, enabling robust support for multimodal datasets, followed by collections and an extensibility mechanism to accommodate evolving scientific needs. These additions emphasize a solid foundation on which future capabilities can be built while providing the stability needed for broader adoption of the format. This presentation will outline the path to 1.0, including community-driven refinements, vendor engagement to ensure complete metadata representation, and alignment with global bioimaging initiatives. As imaging data continues to grow in scale and complexity, consensus-driven evolution of infrastructure will be key to ensuring a truly FAIR future for bioimaging.

NFDI4BIOIMAGE is a newly established German consortium dedicated to the FAIR representation of biological imaging data. A key deliverable is the definition of a semantically-compatible FAIR image object integrating RDF metadata with web-compatible storage of large n-dimensional binary data in OME-Zarr. We invite feedback from and collaboration with other endeavors during the soon-to-begin 5 year funding period.
