Imaging plays a crucial role across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences. However, image data often proves complex, and the volume of images requiring analysis is steadily increasing, especially in high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms. Specifically, analysis pipelines must align to the FAIR principles, ensuring they are reusable and interchangeable across different domains

GloBIAS seminar series
&nbsp;
Part 3 in the topic:&nbsp;
Infrastructure for deploying image analysis workflows
Image analysis using Galaxy

Beatrix Serrano-Solano, Euro-BioImaging ERIC Bio-Hub, EMBL Heidelberg, Germany
&amp; Anne Fouilloux , Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway
&amp; Leonid Kostrykin, Biomedical Computer Vision Group, Heidelberg University, BioQuant, IPMB, Heidelberg, Germany
&amp; Ricardo Massei, Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research, UFZ, Leipzig, Germany
Abstract: This webinar will introduce the Galaxy Image Analysis Community and highlight our mission to advance the development of FAIR and reproducible image analysis workflows. As part of our commitment to making image data analysis more accessible and collaborative, we will showcase how Galaxy can serve the imaging community. The session will explore Galaxy&rsquo;s capabilities for integrating popular image analysis tools, interactive environments, and notebooks, making it a versatile platform for researchers across various scientific domains. We will also present how Galaxy facilitates the creation and sharing of reusable workflows, promoting open science and fostering collaboration. To give participants hands-on insight, we&rsquo;ll provide a live demonstration on designing and running image analysis workflows within Galaxy.&nbsp;
