The presentations introduce open-source software to read in, visualize and analyse fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) raw data developed for life scientists. The slides were presented at German Bioimaging (GerBI) FLIM Workshop held February 26 to 29 2024 at the Biomedical Center of LMU M&uuml;nchen by Anca Margineanu, Chiara Stringari and Conni Wetzker.&nbsp;

The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM) and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;
Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.
Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened the symposium were shared independently:

The workshop organization was funded by the CMCB/PoL Networking Grant and supported by the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE (funded by DFG grant number NFDI 46/1, project number 501864659).
