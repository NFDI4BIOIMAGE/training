Summary:
The BioImage Analysis and Superresolution Microscopy Workshop 2023 took place at Dartmouth College, offering participants a comprehensive learning experience in the field of bioimage analysis and superresolution microscopy. Over the course of two days, researchers, scientists, and students immersed themselves in cutting-edge microscopy techniques and expanded their knowledge and practical skills.

Day 1 (Tue, June 6):
The workshop began with Zdenek Svindrych providing an overview of microscopy principles, methods, and theoretical foundations. Participants gained insights into image formation in fluorescence microscopes, resolution, and noise. This was followed by an introduction to superresolution microscopy techniques, including Single-Molecule localization Microscopy (STORM, PALM, DNA-PAINT) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM, ISM, Airyscan, SoRa). Zuzana Burdikova then guided attendees through the theoretical aspects of bioimage processing in Fiji, covering image formats, multi-dimensional image analysis, data visualization, and quantitative analysis. Practical sessions allowed participants to apply their knowledge, exploring two-channel colocalization, image filtering, and quantitative measurements in Fiji.

Day 2 (Wed, June 7):
The second day commenced with a remote presentation by SVI.nl, introducing participants to the Huygens deconvolution software used in widefield, confocal, and superresolution microscopy. Zdenek Svindrych demonstrated the practical applications of ThunderSTORM, an ImageJ plug-in for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data analysis and superresolution imaging. The session included an overview of the ThunderSTORM workflow, covering localization, filtering, rendering, and 3D STORM using the astigmatism method. Jakub Soukup explored advanced noise reduction algorithms such as Noise2Void and StarDist. Martin Sch&auml;tz discussed data management strategies.

In the afternoon, participants engaged in practical sessions. Martin Sch&auml;tz presented Ilastik, a versatile software for image classification and segmentation. Pat Robison delivered a scientific lecture on the role of detyrosinated microtubules in contracting cardiomyocytes. Zdenek Svindrych, along with other experts, led a hands-on session on customizing Fiji using the ImageJ Macro language. The day concluded with a practical session on the interactive design of GPU-accelerated image data flow graphs in Fiji, guided by Martin Sch&auml;tz and the workshop team.

The software tool is developed on demand of Radiological Department of Faculty Hospital of Kr&aacute;lovsk&eacute; Vinohrady, with the aim to provide a tool to estimate the percentage of pneumonia (or COVID-19 presence) in lungs. Paper&nbsp;Estimation of Covid-19 lungs damage based on computer tomography images analysis presenting the tool is available on F1000reserach&nbsp;DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.109020.1. The underlying dataset is published in Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939).&nbsp;One of the challenges was to design a tool that would be available without complicated install procedures and would process data in a reasonable time even on office computers. For this reason, 8-bit and 16-bit version of the tool exists. The FIJI software (or ImageJ with Bio-Formats plugin installed) was selected as the best candidate. Examples of use and tutorials are available at GitHub.&nbsp;
The third version includes an intra-variabilty analysis, containing evaluation both for percentage and score metrics.
Underlying data:DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939The first five datasets are analyzed using this tool, with results and parameters to repeat the analysis in results_csv.csv or results.xlsx.

The work was funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports by grant &lsquo;Development of Advanced Computational Algorithms for evaluating post-surgery rehabilitation&rsquo; number LTAIN19007. The work was also supported from the grant of Specific university research &ndash; grant No FCHI 2022-001.
