The software tool is developed on demand of Radiological Department of Faculty Hospital of Kr&aacute;lovsk&eacute; Vinohrady, with the aim to provide a tool to estimate the percentage of pneumonia (or COVID-19 presence) in lungs. Paper&nbsp;Estimation of Covid-19 lungs damage based on computer tomography images analysis presenting the tool is available on F1000reserach&nbsp;DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.109020.1. The underlying dataset is published in Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939).&nbsp;One of the challenges was to design a tool that would be available without complicated install procedures and would process data in a reasonable time even on office computers. For this reason, 8-bit and 16-bit version of the tool exists. The FIJI software (or ImageJ with Bio-Formats plugin installed) was selected as the best candidate. Examples of use and tutorials are available at GitHub.&nbsp;
The third version includes an intra-variabilty analysis, containing evaluation both for percentage and score metrics.
Underlying data:DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939The first five datasets are analyzed using this tool, with results and parameters to repeat the analysis in results_csv.csv or results.xlsx.

The slides were presented during the Macro programming with ImageJ workshop (https://www.16mcm.cz/programme/#workshops) which was part of the&nbsp;16th Multinational Congress on Microscopy. It is a collection and &quot;reshuffle&quot; of slides originally made by Robert Haase on topics from Image Analysis in general up to&nbsp;User-friendly GPU-accelerated bio-image analysis and CLIJ2.

Research data management and how not to get overwhelmed with data presentation is an overview of bioimage analysis with a focus on the basics for data management planning, FAIR principles, and how to practically organize folders and prepares naming convention. The presentation includes an overview of metadata, Creative Common licenses, and a sum up of electronic laboratory notebooks. The last two slides go through how all of that works in practice in open access core microscopy facility.

Licensed OTHER-OPEN



SciAugment v0.2.0 has pip installable version, channel-wise augmentation was added, and an option for all augmentations or no augmentation. Examples of how to use the tool are in README and in Google Colab notebooks. Practical examples of how to use results with YOLOv5 on scientific data can be found in the SciCount project.

SciAugment aims to provide an option to create an augmented image set with similar changes in data as the imaging sensor and technique would do.

Published 2022-08-02

Licensed OTHER-OPEN



The first version contains an example of augmentation of scientific data and object detection with YOLO_v5 on colony counting (2 classes), object counting in blood smears (can be used as semisupervised learning for faster annotation), and wildlife detection from night records with a camera trap.

The project is available on GitHub.
