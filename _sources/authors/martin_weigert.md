The dataset consists of 28 confocal microscopy volumes of C. elegans worms at the L1 stage and&nbsp; corresponding stacks of densely annotated nuclei instance segmentation masks.

* 28 raw images and corresponding masks of average dimension (xyz) 1050 x 140 x 140
* Pixelsize (xyz): 0.116 x 0.116 x 0.122&mu;m
* Microscope: Leica confocal microscopy, 63x oil objective


The original raw data and preliminary annotations were&nbsp; part of the following publication (please cite if you use the dataset):
&nbsp;
Long, F., Peng, H., Liu, X., Kim, S. K., &amp; Myers, E. (2009). A 3D digital atlas of C. elegans and its application to single-cell analyses. Nature methods, 6(9), 667-672.

The nuclei annotation masks were further manually curated by Dagmar Kainmueller (MDC Berlin) for the following publication:

Hirsch, P., &amp; Kainmueller, D. (2020). An auxiliary task for learning nuclei segmentation in 3d microscopy images. In&nbsp;Medical Imaging with Deep Learning&nbsp;(pp. 304-321). PMLR.

We provide the dataset already structured into the train/validation/test split as used by the above as well as the following publications:&nbsp;

## Ground-truth cell body segmentation used for Starfinity training

Accurate segmentation of volumetric fluorescence image data has been a long-standing challenge and it can considerably degrade the accuracy of multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. To overcome this challenge, we developed a deep learning-based automatic 3D segmentation algorithm, called Starfinity. It first predicts its cell center probability and its radial distances to the nearest cell borders for each pixel. It then aggregates pixel affinity maps from the densely predicted distances and applies a watershed segmentation on the affinity maps using the thresholded center probability as seeds.
