## Implantation of abdominal imaging windows on the mouse kidney

Published 2024-09-04

Licensed CC-BY-ND-4.0



This video describes the surgical process of implanting an abdominal imaging window (AIW) on the kidney of mice. This window can be used for acute or longitudinal imaging. All experiments have been reviewed and approved by the local authorities (Landesdirektion Sachsen).
Implantation of chronic abdominal windows allows for microscopical investigation of highly dynamic processes in physiological and pathological circumstances and is generally tolerated well by experimental animals. It enables insights which otherwise could only be obtained using high numbers of experimental animals. The method can be regarded as reduction approach in terms of 3R implementation.

## Intravital microscopy contrasting agents for application - Database

Michael Gerlach

Published 2024-06-19

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This is a set of databases containing published use of substances which can be applied to rodents in order to contrast specific structures for optical intravital microscopy.
The first dataset contains applied final dosages, calculated for 25g-mice, as well as the orignally published amounts, concentrations and application routes of agents directly applied into the target organism.
The second dataset contains dosages and cell numbers for the external contrastation and subsequent application of cells into the target organism.
Filtering possible for organ system and contrasted structure/cell type in both datasets, substance class and fluorescent detection windows can be filtered in the dataset for direct agent application.
Source publications are listed by DOI.
