## Implantation of abdominal imaging windows on the mouse kidney

Licensed CC-BY-ND-4.0



This video describes the surgical process of implanting an abdominal imaging window (AIW) on the kidney of mice. This window can be used for acute or longitudinal imaging. All experiments have been reviewed and approved by the local authorities (Landesdirektion Sachsen).
Implantation of chronic abdominal windows allows for microscopical investigation of highly dynamic processes in physiological and pathological circumstances and is generally tolerated well by experimental animals. It enables insights which otherwise could only be obtained using high numbers of experimental animals. The method can be regarded as reduction approach in terms of 3R implementation.

## Intravital microscopy contrasting agents for application - Database

Michael Gerlach

Published 2024-06-19

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This is a set of databases containing published use of substances which can be applied to rodents in order to contrast specific structures for optical intravital microscopy.
The first dataset contains applied final dosages, calculated for 25g-mice, as well as the orignally published amounts, concentrations and application routes of agents directly applied into the target organism.
The second dataset contains dosages and cell numbers for the external contrastation and subsequent application of cells into the target organism.
Filtering possible for organ system and contrasted structure/cell type in both datasets, substance class and fluorescent detection windows can be filtered in the dataset for direct agent application.
Source publications are listed by DOI.

## Key-Value pair template for annotation of datasets in OMERO for light- and electron microscopy data within the research group of Prof. Müller-Reichert

This are a two Key-Value pair templates used for the annotation of datasets in OMERO. They are tailored for light- and electron microcopy data for all research projects of the research group of Prof. T. Mueller-Reichert.&nbsp; All members of the Core Facility Cellular Imaging agreed for using these templates to annotate data in OMERO. Furthermore, there are a corresponding public example datasets used in the publication "Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users" and are available here:
https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=dataset-1552 --&gt; for lattice-light sheet microscopy
https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=dataset-1555--&gt; for electron microscopy data
That templates are based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015) and were developed during the PoL-Bio-Image Analysis Symposium in Dresden Aug 28th- Sept 1st in 2023 and further adapeted during the usage of OMERO.&nbsp;
With every template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate a dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).
How to use:

fill the template with metadata
select and copy the data range containing the Keys and Values
open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in cell A1
Important: cell A1 contains always the name 'dataset' and cell A2 contains the exact name of the dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv-file (comma separated values) format

Examples can be seen in sheet 3 'csv_TOMO' and sheet 5 csv_TEM'.
Important note: The code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might be not able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft-Office versions (MS Office 2016).&nbsp;
Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of comma as decimal delimiter.
