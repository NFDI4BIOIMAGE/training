## Evident OIR sample files with lambda scan - FV 4000

Published 2024-07-18

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



The files contained in this repository are confocal images taken with the Evident FV 4000 of a sample containing DAPI and mCherry stains, excited with the 405 nm laser and images for different emission windows (lambda scan).
They are public sample files which goal is to help test edge cases of the bio-formats library (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/), in particular for the proper handling of lambda scans.

DAPI_mCherry_22Lambda-420-630-w10nm-s10nm.oir : 22 planes, each plane is an emission window, starting from 420 nm up to 630 nm by steps of 10 nm
DAPI_mCherry_4T_5Lambda-420-630-w10nm-s50nm.oir : 20 planes, 5 lambdas from 420 to 630 nm by steps of 50 nm, 4 timepoints
DAPI_mCherry_4Z_5Lambda-420-630-w10nm-s50nm.oir : 20 planes, 5 lambdas from 420 to 630 nm by steps of 50 nm, 4 slices
DAPI-mCherry_3T_4Z_5Lambda-420-630-w10nm-s50nm.oir : 60 planes, 5 lambdas from 420 to 630 nm by steps of 50 nm, 4 slices, 3 timepoints

This is a microscopy image dataset generated by the Perkin Elmer Operetta HCS microscope by of the user of the PTBIOP EPFL facility.
As of the 17th of July 2023, opening this file in ImageJ/Fiji using the BioFormats 6.14 library, this dataset generates a Null Pointer Exception.

## Test Dataset for Whole Slide Image Registration

Romain Guiet, Nicolas Chiaruttini

Published 2021-04-12

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Mouse duodenum fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4&deg;C, processed for paraffin infiltration using a standard histology procedure and cut at 4 microns were dewaxed, rehydrated, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS 1x and stained with Azide - Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher) to detect EdU and DAPI for nuclei. The images were taken using a Leica DM5500 microscope with a 40X N.A.1 objective (black&amp;white camera: DFC350FXR2, pixel dimension: 0.161 microns). Next, the slide was unmounted and stained using the fully automated Ventana Discovery xT autostainer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). All steps were performed on automate with Ventana solutions. Sections were pretreated with heat using the CC1 solution under mild conditions. The primary rat anti BrDU (clone: BU1/75 (ICR1), Serotec, diluted 1:300) was incubated 1 hour at 37&deg;C. After incubation with a donkey anti rat biotin diluted 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), chromogenic revelation was performed with DabMap kit. The section was counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (J.T. Baker) before a second round of imaging on DM5500 PL Fluotar 40X N.A.1.0 oil (color camera: DFC 320 R2, pixel dimension: 0.1725 microns). Before acquisition, a white-balance as well as a shading correction is performed according to Leica LAS software wizard. The fluorescence and DAB images were converted in ome.tiff multiresolution file with the kheops Fiji Plugin.

Sampled prepared in the EPFL histology core facility by Nathalie M&uuml;ller and Gian-Filippo Mancini.
