Interdisciplinary collaboration and integration of large and diverse datasets are becoming increasingly important. Answering complex research questions requires combining and analysing multimodal datasets. Research data management follows the FAIR principles making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. However, there are challenges in capturing the entire research cycle and contextualizing data according, not only for the DataPLANT and NFDI4BIOIMAGE communities. To address these challenges, DataPLANT developed a data structure called Annotated Research Context (ARC). The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) originated from the neuroimaging community extended for microscopic image data. Both concepts provide standardised and file system based data storage structures for organising and sharing research data accompanied with metadata. We exemplarily compare the ARC and BIDS designs and propose structural and metadata mapping.

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

This repository documents the first NFDI4Bioimage - TA3-Hackathon - UoC-2023 (Cologne Hackathon), where topics like 'Interoperability', 'REMBI / Mapping', and 'Neuroglancer (OMERO / zarr)' were explored through collaborative discussions and workflow sessions, culminating in reports that bridge NFDI4Bioimage to DataPLANT. Funded by various DFG initiatives, this event emphasized documentation and use cases, contributing preparatory work for future interoperability projects at the 2nd de.NBI BioHackathon in Bielefeld.
