High-content screening (HCS) bioimaging automates the imaging and analysis of numerous biological samples, generating extensive metadata that is crucial for effective image management and interpretation. Efficiently handling this complex data is essential to implementing FAIR principles and realizing HCS's full potential for scientific discoveries.

The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM) and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;
Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.
Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened the symposium were shared independently:

The workshop organization was funded by the CMCB/PoL Networking Grant and supported by the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE (funded by DFG grant number NFDI 46/1, project number 501864659).

## OMERO - HCS analysis pipeline using Jupyter Notebooks

['Riccardo Massei']

Licensed MIT



Material and solutions for the course 'Bioimage data management and analysis with OMERO' held in Heidelberg (13th May 2024) - Module 3 (1.45 pm - 3.45 pm): OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks. Main goal of the workflow is to show the potential of JN to perform reproducible image analysis in connection with an OMERO instance. In this specific example, we are performing a simple nuclei segmentation from raw images uploaded in OMERO.
