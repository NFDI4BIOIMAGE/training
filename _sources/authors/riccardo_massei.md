Imaging plays a crucial role across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences. However, image data often proves complex, and the volume of images requiring analysis is steadily increasing, especially in high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms. Specifically, analysis pipelines must align to the FAIR principles, ensuring they are reusable and interchangeable across different domains

KNIME and Galaxy are leading workflow platforms widely used for imaging, data analysis, and automation. However, differences in their architectures make translating imaging workflows between them difficult and time- consuming. The lack of automated conversion workflow reuse. Enabling automatic conversion of KNIME imaging workflows into Galaxy could enhance accessibility, streamline image analysis with further Open Source Tools (i.e. OMERO, INTOB), and accelerate imaging-based scientific discovery. Our goal is to develop generative AI strategies for automated KNIME-to- Galaxy workflow translation using large language models (LLM). By learning from test workflows, the system will adapt to platform changes and improve accuracy over time.

Imaging is crucial across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences, where it plays a key role in studies ranging from single molecules to whole organisms. However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data present significant challenges. Managing and analyzing this data efficiently requires well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR principles—ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable across different domains. In the frame of NFDI4BIOIMAGE1 (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing, analyzing, and sharing bioimaging data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to make findable and machine-readable metadata developing analysis pipelines. In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity, supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata. Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis2. By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases the efficiency of RDM processes in bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific community's efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation. In the present poster, we showed how to integrate RDM processes and tools in Galaxy. We will showcase how Images can be enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to a target OME Remote Objects (OMERO) server using a novel set of OMERO tools developed with Galaxy3. Workflows give the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and perform image analysis (i.e. annotation). Furthermore, we will show the potential integration of eletronic lab books such as eLabFTW4, cloud storage systems (i.e. OneData)5 and interactive norebooks (Jupyter Notebooks) 6 in the Galaxy pipeline.

The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM) and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;
Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.
Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened the symposium were shared independently:

Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) aims to establish a sustained, cross-disciplinary research data management (RDM) infrastructure that enables researchers to handle FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data. While&nbsp;FAIR principles have been&nbsp;adopted by funders, policymakers, and publishers, their practical implementation remains an ongoing effort. In the field of bio-imaging, harmonization of&nbsp;data formats, metadata ontologies, and open data repositories is necessary&nbsp;to achieve FAIR data.&nbsp;The NFDI4BIOIMAGE was established&nbsp;to address these issues and&nbsp;develop tools and best practices to facilitate FAIR microscopy and image analysis data in alignment with international community activities. The&nbsp;consortium operates through its Data Stewards team to provide expertise and direct support to help overcome RDM challenges. The three Helmholtz Centers in NFDI4BIOIMAGE aim to collaborate closely with other centers and initiatives, such as HMC, Helmholtz AI, and HIP. Here we present NFDI4BIOIMAGE&rsquo;s work and its significance for research in Helmholtz and beyond

## [Workshop] Bioimage data management and analysis with OMERO

Riccardo Massei, Michele Bortolomeazzi, Christian Schmidt

Published 2024-05-13

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024, at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)
Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.
Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation
Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji
Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks
Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with OMERO
The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection to their institutional networks to access OMERO
Who are the trainers?
