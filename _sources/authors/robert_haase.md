Large Language Models (LLMs) change the way how we use computers. This also has impact on the bio-image analysis community. We can generate code that analyzes biomedical image data if we ask the right prompts. This talk outlines introduces basic principles, explains prompt engineering and how to apply it to bio-image analysis. We also compare how different LLM vendors perform on code generation tasks and which challenges are ahead for the bio-image analysis community.

In this SaxFDM Digital Kitchen, I introduced current challenges and potential solutions for openly sharing training materials, softly focusing on bio-image analysis. In this field a lot of training materials circulate in private channels, but openly shared, reusable materials, according to the FAIR-principles, are still rare. Using the CC-BY license and uploading materials to publicly acessible repositories are proposed to fill this gap.

The upload contains StarDist models for segmenting enteric neurons in 2D, enteric neuronal subtypes in 2D and FPN+ResNet101 model for enteric ganglia in 2D in gut wholemount tissue. GAT is implemented in Fiji, but the models can be used in any software that supports StarDist and the use of 2D UNet models.&nbsp;The files here also consist of&nbsp;Python notebooks (Google Colab), training and test data as well as reports on model performance.
Note: The enteric ganglia model is has been updated to v3 which uses pytorch and is a different architecture (FPN+ResNet101).
The model files are located in the respective folders as zip files. The folders have also been zipped:

Neuron (Hu; StarDist&nbsp;model):

Main folder: 2D_enteric_neuron_model_QA.zip
StarDist Model File:2D_enteric_neuron_v4_1.zip&nbsp;
DeepImageJ compatible model: 2D_enteric_neuron.bioimage.io.model.zip (used currently in GAT)


Neuronal subtype (StarDist&nbsp;model):&nbsp;

Main folder: 2D_enteric_neuron_subtype_model_QA.zip
Model File: 2D_enteric_neuron_subtype_v4.zip
DeepImageJ compatible model: 2D_enteric_neuron_subtype.bioimage.io.model.zip (used currently in GAT)


Enteric ganglia (2D FPN_ResNet101; Use in FIJI with&nbsp;deepImageJ)

Main folder: 2D_enteric_ganglia_v3_training.zip
Model File: 2D_Ganglia_RGB_v3.bioimage.io.model.zip (used currently in GAT)



For the all models, files included are:

Model for segmenting cells or ganglia in 2D FIJI. StarDist or 2D UNet.
Training and Test datasets used for training.
Google Colab notebooks used for training and quality assurance (ZeroCost DL4Mic notebooks).
Python notebook and code for training ganglia model with QA.
Quality assurance reports generated from above notebooks.
StarDist model exported for use in QuPath.

The model files can be used within can be used within the software,&nbsp;StarDist. They&nbsp;are intended to be used within FIJI or QuPath, but can be used in any software that supports the implementation of StarDist in 2D.
Data:
All the images were collected from 4 different research labs and a public database (SPARC database) to account for variations in image acquisition, sample preparation and immunolabelling.
For enteric neurons&nbsp;the pan-neuronal marker, Hu&nbsp;has been used and the&nbsp; 2D wholemounts images from mouse, rat and human tissue.
For enteric neuronal subtypes, 2D images for nNOS, MOR, DOR, ChAT, Calretinin, Calbindin, Neurofilament, CGRP and SST from mouse tissue have been used..
25 images were used&nbsp;from the following entries in the&nbsp;SPARC database:

Howard, M. (2021). 3D imaging of enteric neurons in mouse (Version 1) [Data set]. SPARC Consortium. 
Graham, K. D., Huerta-Lopez, S., Sengupta, R., Shenoy, A., Schneider, S., Wright, C. M., Feldman, M., Furth, E., Lemke, A., Wilkins, B. J., Naji, A., Doolin, E., Howard, M., &amp; Heuckeroth, R.

The images have been acquired using a combination different microscopes. The images for the mouse tissue were acquired using:&nbsp;


Leica TCS-SP8 confocal system (20x HC PL APO NA 1.33, 40 x HC PL APO NA 1.3)&nbsp;


Leica TCS-SP8 lightning confocal system (20x HC PL APO NA 0.88)&nbsp;


Zeiss Axio Imager M2 (20X HC PL APO NA 0.3)&nbsp;


Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 (10X HC PL APO NA 0.45)&nbsp;


Human tissue images were acquired using:&nbsp;


IX71 Olympus microscope (10X HC PL APO NA 0.3)&nbsp;


For more information, visit the&nbsp;Documentation website.
NOTE: The images for enteric neurons and neuronal subtypes have been rescaled to 0.568 &micro;m/pixel for mouse and rat. For human neurons, it has been rescaled to 0.9 &micro;m/pixel . This is to ensure the neuronal cell bodies have similar pixel area across images. The area of cells in pixels can vary based on resolution of image, magnification of objective used, animal species (larger animals -&gt; larger neurons) and potentially how the tissue is stretched during wholemount preparation&nbsp;
Average neuron area for neuronal model:&nbsp;701.2 &plusmn; 195.9 pixel2 (Mean &plusmn; SD, 6267 cells)
Average neuron area for neuronal subtype model:&nbsp;880.9 &plusmn; 316 pixel2 (Mean &plusmn; SD, 924 cells)

The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT changes the way we analyse images. We ask LLMs to generate code, apply it to images and spend less time on learning implementation details. This also has impact on how we learn image analysis. While coding skills are still required, we can use LLMs to explain code, make proposals how to analyse the images and yet still decide how the analysis is done.

## Optimisation and Validation of a Swarm Intelligence based Segmentation Algorithm for low Contrast Positron Emission Tomography

Robert Haase

Published 2014-04-01

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In the field of radiooncological research, individualised therapy is one of the hot topics at the moment. As a key aspect biologically-adapted therapy is discussed. Therapy adaption based on biological parameters&nbsp;may include tomographic imaging to determine biological properties of the tumour. One often invoked&nbsp;imaging modality is positron emission tomography (PET) using the tracer [18F]-fluoromisonidazole&nbsp;(FMISO) for hypoxia imaging. Hypoxia imaging is of interest, because hypoxic tumours are known to be radiorestistant. Even further, patients with hypoxic tumours have worse prognosis compared to patients&nbsp;with normoxic tumours. Thus, hypoxia imaging appears promising for radiotherapy treatment adaption.&nbsp;For example, volumetric analysis of FMISO PET could deliver additional hypoxia target volumes, which&nbsp;may be irradiated with higher radiation doses to improve the therapeutic effect. However, limited contrast&nbsp;between target volume and background in FMISO PET images interferes image analysis.Established&nbsp;methods for target volume delineation in PET do not allow determination of reliable contours in FMISO PET. To tackle this aspect, this thesis focusses on an earlier developed swarm intelligence based&nbsp;segmentation algorithm for FMISO PET and rather, its optimisation and validation in a clinically relevant&nbsp;setting. In this setting, clinical FMISO PET images were used which were acquired as part of a clinical&nbsp;trial performed at the Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy and Radiooncology of the University&nbsp;Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. The segmentation algorithm was applied to these imaging data&nbsp;sets and optimised using a cross-validation approach incorporating reference contours from experienced&nbsp;observers who outlined FMISO PET positive volumes manually. Afterwards, the performance of the algorithm&nbsp;and the properties of the resulting contours were studied in more detail. The algorithm was shown&nbsp;to deliver contours which were similar to manually-created contours to a degree like manually-created&nbsp;contours were similar to each other. Thus, the application of the algorithm in clinical research is recommended&nbsp;to eliminate inter-observer-variabilities. Finally, it was shown that repeated FMISO PET imaging&nbsp;before and shortly after the beginning of combined radiochemotherapy lead to manually-created contours&nbsp;with significantly higher variations than the variations of automatically-created contours using the&nbsp;proposed algorithm. Increased contour similarity in subsequently acquired imaging data highlights the&nbsp;observer-independence of the algorithm. While several observers outline different volumes, in identical&nbsp;data sets as well as in subsequent imaging data sets, the algorithm outlines more stable volumes in both&nbsp;cases. Thus, increased contour reproducibility is reached by automation of the delineation process by&nbsp;the proposed algorithm.&nbsp;

Bioimage analysis (BIA), a crucial discipline in biological research, overcomes the limitations of subjective analysis in microscopy through the creation and application of quantitative and reproducible methods. The establishment of dedicated BIA support within academic institutions is vital to improving research quality and efficiency and can significantly advance scientific discovery. However, a lack of training resources, limited career paths and insufficient recognition of the contributions made by bioimage analysts prevent the full realization of this potential. This Perspective – the result of the recent The Company of Biologists Workshop ‘Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis’, which aimed to summarize the global BIA landscape, categorize obstacles and offer possible solutions – proposes strategies to bring about a cultural shift towards recognizing the value of BIA by standardizing tools, improving training and encouraging formal credit for contributions
