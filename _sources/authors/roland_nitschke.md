Example Microscopy Metadata (Microscope.JSON and Settings.JSON) files produced using Micro-Meta App to document the Hardware Specifications of example Microscopes and the Image Acquisition Settings utilized to acquire example images as listed in the table below.


For each facility, the dataset contains two JSON files:


	Microscope.JSON file (e.g., 01_marcello_uliverpool_cci_zeiss_axioobserz1_lsm710.json)
	Settings.JSON file (indicated with the name of the image and with the _AS suffix)



Micro-Meta App was developed as part of a global community initiative including the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Imaging Working Group, BioImaging North America (BINA) Quality Control and Data Management Working Group, and QUAlity and REProducibility for Instrument and Images in Light Microscopy (QUAREP-LiMi), to extend the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) data model.


The works of this global community effort resulted in multiple publications featured on a recent Nature Methods FOCUS ISSUE dedicated to Reporting and reproducibility in microscopy.

Together with the molecular knowledge of genes and proteins, biological images promise to significantly enhance the scientific understanding of complex cellular systems and to advance predictive and personalized therapeutic products for human health. For this potential to be realized, quality-assured image data must be shared among labs at a global scale to be compared, pooled, and reanalyzed, thus unleashing untold potential beyond the original purpose for which the data was generated.

## The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project to advance FAIR microscopy data management for the community

Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing, researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.
