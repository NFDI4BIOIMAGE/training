Name: 3D Nuclei annotations and StarDist3D model(s) (rat brain)

Images:&nbsp;&nbsp;From a large tiling acquisition ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6646128 ) individual Tile (xyz : 1024x1024x62) were downsampled and cropped (128x128x62). Four crops, from different tiles (./annotations_BIOP/images/) were manually annotated with ITK-SNAP (./annotations_BIOP/masks/)

These four images, and their corresponding masks, were cropped into four quadrants (./crops_BIOP_v1/) in order to get 16 different images (64x64x62).

Conda environment:&nbsp;A conda environment was created using the yml file &nbsp;stardist0.8_TF1.15.yml

Training :&nbsp;Training was performed using the jupyter notebook 1-Training_notebook.ipynb.
Three different trainings (with the same random seed, same anisotropy, patch size and grid) were performed and produced three different models (./models/)

Validation images (from the random seed used) were exported to ease the visual inspection of the results(./val_rdm42/).

Validation:&nbsp;&nbsp;To save metrics in a csv file and compare predictions to the annotations the jupyter notebook 2-QC_notebook.ipynb can be used on the validation folder.

Large images: To test the model on larger images one can use Whole_ds441.tif (or Crop_ds441.tif )
These images were obtained using the plugin BigSticher on the raw data ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6646128 ), resaved as h5 and exported the downsample&nbsp;by 4 version.

## Automatic labelling of HeLa "Kyoto" cells using Deep Learning tools

Romain Guiet

Name: Automatic labelling&nbsp;of HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells using Deep Learning tools

Data type: Microscopy images from the dataset &ldquo;HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells&nbsp;under the scope&rdquo;, Brightfield (BF), Digital Phase Contrast (DPC, either &ldquo;raw&rdquo; or &ldquo;square-rooted&rdquo;), Tubulin and H2B fluorescent channel, paired with their corresponding nuclei or cell/cyto label images.

Labels images: Labels images were generated using the script &ldquo;prepare_trainingDataset_cellpose.ijm&rdquo;.

Briefly, for 5 defined time-points (1,10,50,100,150), channels of interest were duplicated, resaved and :

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nuclei label images were obtained using StarDist on H2B channel

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cell label images were obtained using Cellpose on Tubulin and H2B channels

A quick visual inspection of the resulting label images concluded that they were satisfying enough, despite certainly not being perfect.

Notes :

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This labelling&nbsp;strategy:

o&nbsp;&nbsp; will not produce 100% accurate labels, but they might be more reproducible than labels generated by humans and are (definitely) much faster to obtain.

o&nbsp;&nbsp; is NOT a recommended way of generating labels images, but for educational purposes.

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fluorescent channels are part of the dataset to ease the process of review of the labels and are NOT used for training. We generated the labels from the fluorescent channels to later predict labels from the BF or DPC channels only. As such, the fluorescent channels should not be &ldquo;reused&rdquo; with our labels during training.

File format: .tif (16-bit)

Image size: 540x540 (Pixel size: 0.299 nm)

&nbsp;

NOTE: This dataset uses&nbsp;the &ldquo;HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells&nbsp;under the scope&rdquo; &nbsp;dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6139958) to automatically generate annotations

NOTE: This dataset was used to train cellpose models in the following Zenodo entry&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6140111

Mouse duodenum fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4&deg;C, processed for paraffin infiltration using a standard histology procedure and cut at 4 microns were dewaxed, rehydrated, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS 1x and stained with Azide - Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher) to detect EdU and DAPI for nuclei. The images were taken using a Leica DM5500 microscope with a 40X N.A.1 objective (black&amp;white camera: DFC350FXR2, pixel dimension: 0.161 microns). Next, the slide was unmounted and stained using the fully automated Ventana Discovery xT autostainer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). All steps were performed on automate with Ventana solutions. Sections were pretreated with heat using the CC1 solution under mild conditions. The primary rat anti BrDU (clone: BU1/75 (ICR1), Serotec, diluted 1:300) was incubated 1 hour at 37&deg;C. After incubation with a donkey anti rat biotin diluted 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), chromogenic revelation was performed with DabMap kit. The section was counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (J.T. Baker) before a second round of imaging on DM5500 PL Fluotar 40X N.A.1.0 oil (color camera: DFC 320 R2, pixel dimension: 0.1725 microns). Before acquisition, a white-balance as well as a shading correction is performed according to Leica LAS software wizard. The fluorescence and DAB images were converted in ome.tiff multiresolution file with the kheops Fiji Plugin.

Sampled prepared in the EPFL histology core facility by Nathalie M&uuml;ller and Gian-Filippo Mancini.
