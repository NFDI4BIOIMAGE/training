The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

## RDF as a bridge to domain-platforms like OMERO, or There and back again.

In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However, just a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the development of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes it possible to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot immediately be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering the benefit of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing, researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.

## Zarr - A Cloud-Optimized Storage for Interactive Access of Large Arrays

For decades, the sharing of large N-dimensional datasets has posed issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or down-sampled representations on the fly. Now, a cloud-native chunked format easing this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The format — Zarr — is potentially of interest for other consortia and sections of NFDI.

Poster presented at Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Health Care and Life Sciences (SWAT4HCLS 2023), Feb 13--16, 2023, Basel, Switzerland. NFDI4BIOIMAGE is a newly established German consortium dedicated to the FAIR representation of biological imaging data. A key deliverable is the definition of a semantically-compatible FAIR image object integrating RDF metadata with web-compatible storage of large n-dimensional binary data in OME-Zarr. We invite feedback from and collaboration with other endeavors during the soon-to-begin 5 year funding period.

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions
Establish a stakeholder process management for installing OMERO-based RDM
Learn from each other, leverage different expertise
Learn how to train users, establish sustainability strategies, and foster FAIR RDM for bioimaging at your institution
