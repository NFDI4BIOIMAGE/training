## Excel template for adding Key-Value Pairs to images

This Excel Workbook contains some simple Macros to help with the generation of a .csv in the necessary format for Key-Value pair annotations of images in OMERO.
The format is tailored for the OMERO.web script&nbsp;"KeyVal_from_csv.py"&nbsp; (from the version &lt;=5.8.3 of the core omero-scripts).
Attached is also a video of Thomas Zobel, the head of the imaging core facility Uni M&uuml;nster, showcasing the use of the Excel workbook.The video uses a slightly older version of the workbook and OMERO, but the core functionality remains unchanged.
Please keep in mind, that the OMERO.web script(s) to handle Key-Value Pairs from/to .csv files will undergo a major change very soon.This might break the compatibility with the format used now for the generated .csv from the workbook.

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.
