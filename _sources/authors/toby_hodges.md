In this interactive session, Carpentries team members will guide attendees through three stages of the backward design process to create a lesson development plan for the open source tool of their choosing. Attendees will leave having identified what practical skills they aim to teach (learning objectives), an approach for designing challenge questions (formative assessment), and mechanisms to give and receive feedback.
