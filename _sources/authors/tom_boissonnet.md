The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM) and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;
Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.
Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened the symposium were shared independently:

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

## [Workshop] FAIR data handling for microscopy: Structured metadata annotation in OMERO

Description
Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:

Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining
Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO

The target group for this workshop
This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Who are the trainers (see trainer description below for more details)

Dr. Vanessa Fuchs (NFDI4BIOIMAGE Data Steward, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich-Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich-Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
