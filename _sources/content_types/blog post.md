## CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

Geeth Sethi, Sumith Kulal, Kevin Zakka, William Shen, Rachel Gardner

Licensed UNKNOWN



 ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.
