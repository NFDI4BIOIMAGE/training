Published 2022-06-17

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Here we present a benchmarking dataset of fluorescence microscopy images with Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei together with annotations of nuclei, nuclear fragments and micronuclei. Images were randomly selected from an RNA interference screen with a modified U2OS osteosarcoma cell line, acquired on a Thermo Fischer CX7 high-content imaging system at 20x magnification. Labelling was performed by a single annotator and reviewed by a biomedical expert.

The dataset contains 50 images showing over 2000 labelled nuclear objects in total, which is sufficiently large to train well-performing neural networks for instance or semantic segmentation. It is pre-split into training, development and test set, each in a zip file. The dataset should be referred to as Aitslab_bioimaging1. A brief article describing the dataset is also available (Arvidsson M, Kazemi Rashed S, Aits S. 10.1016/j.dib.2022.108769 )

## Assessment of Residual Breast Cancer Cellularity after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy using Digital Pathology

Mohammad Peikari, Sherine Salama, Sharon Nofech-Mozes, Anne L. Martel

Published 2017-10-04

Licensed CC-BY-3.0



Breast cancer (BC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S. with more than 250,000 new cases of invasive breast cancers reported in 2017. The majority of women with locally advanced and a subset of patients with operable breast cancer will undergo systemic therapy prior to their surgery (neoadjuvant therapy/ NAT) to reduce the size of tumor(s) and possibly further undergo breast conserving surgery. The Post-NAT-BRCA dataset is a collection of representative sections from breast resections in patients with residual invasive BC following NAT. Histologic sections were prepared and digitized to produce high resolution, microscopic images of treated BC tumors. Also included, are clinical features and expert pathology annotations of tumor cellularity and cell types. The Residual Cancer Burden Index (RCBi), is a clinically validated tool for assessment of response to NAT associated with prognosis. Tumor cellularity is one of the parameters used for calculating the RCBi. In this dataset, tumor cellularity refers to a measure of residual disease after NAT, in the form of proportion of malignant tumor inside the tumor bed region; also annotated. (See MD Anderson RCB Calculator for a detailed description of tumor cellularity.) Malignant, healthy, lymphocyte and other labels were also provided for individual cells to aid development of cell segmentation algorithms.

## Automatic labelling of HeLa "Kyoto" cells using Deep Learning tools

Romain Guiet

Published 2022-02-25

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Name: Automatic labelling&nbsp;of HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells using Deep Learning tools

Data type: Microscopy images from the dataset &ldquo;HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells&nbsp;under the scope&rdquo;, Brightfield (BF), Digital Phase Contrast (DPC, either &ldquo;raw&rdquo; or &ldquo;square-rooted&rdquo;), Tubulin and H2B fluorescent channel, paired with their corresponding nuclei or cell/cyto label images.

Labels images: Labels images were generated using the script &ldquo;prepare_trainingDataset_cellpose.ijm&rdquo;.

Briefly, for 5 defined time-points (1,10,50,100,150), channels of interest were duplicated, resaved and :

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nuclei label images were obtained using StarDist on H2B channel

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cell label images were obtained using Cellpose on Tubulin and H2B channels

A quick visual inspection of the resulting label images concluded that they were satisfying enough, despite certainly not being perfect.

Notes :

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This labelling&nbsp;strategy:

o&nbsp;&nbsp; will not produce 100% accurate labels, but they might be more reproducible than labels generated by humans and are (definitely) much faster to obtain.

o&nbsp;&nbsp; is NOT a recommended way of generating labels images, but for educational purposes.

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fluorescent channels are part of the dataset to ease the process of review of the labels and are NOT used for training. We generated the labels from the fluorescent channels to later predict labels from the BF or DPC channels only. As such, the fluorescent channels should not be &ldquo;reused&rdquo; with our labels during training.

File format: .tif (16-bit)

Image size: 540x540 (Pixel size: 0.299 nm)

&nbsp;

NOTE: This dataset uses&nbsp;the &ldquo;HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells&nbsp;under the scope&rdquo; &nbsp;dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6139958) to automatically generate annotations

NOTE: This dataset was used to train cellpose models in the following Zenodo entry&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6140111

## Deep learning training data (JOVE)

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows researchers to image cells in their native, hydrated state at the highest resolution currently possible. However, the technique has several limitations that make analyzing the data it generates time-intensive and difficult. Hand-segmenting a single tomogram can take hours to days of human effort, but the microscope can easily generate 50 or more tomograms a day. Current deep learning segmentation programs for cryo-ET do exist but are limited to segmenting one structure at a time. Here multi-slice U-Net convolutional neural networks are trained and applied to automatically segment multiple structures simultaneously within cryo-tomograms. With proper preprocessing, these networks can be robustly inferred to many tomograms without the need for training individual networks for each tomogram. This workflow dramatically improves the speed with which cryo-electron tomograms can be analyzed by cutting segmentation time down to under 30 min in most cases. Further, segmentations can be used to improve the accuracy of filament tracing within a cellular context and to rapidly extract coordinates for subtomogram averaging.

A novel contour-based approach to cell detection and segmentation has been developed, which uses minimal prior information and detects contours independently of their shape, avoiding a segmentation bias. This approach has been shown to accurately segment a broad range of normal and disease-related morphological features, with high precision and recall rates.

Licensed CC0-1.0



Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 cells were stained for DNA (to label nuclei) and actin (a cytoskeletal protein, to show the cell body). Automatic cytometry requires that cells be segmented, i.e., that the pixels belonging to each cell be identified. Because segmenting nuclei and distinguishing foreground from background is comparatively easy for these images, the focus here is on finding the boundaries between adjacent cells.

Accurate segmentation of volumetric fluorescence image data has been a long-standing challenge and it can considerably degrade the accuracy of multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. To overcome this challenge, we developed a deep learning-based automatic 3D segmentation algorithm, called Starfinity. It first predicts its cell center probability and its radial distances to the nearest cell borders for each pixel. It then aggregates pixel affinity maps from the densely predicted distances and applies a watershed segmentation on the affinity maps using the thresholded center probability as seeds.

## Human HT29 colon-cancer cells

Licensed CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0



These images are of human HT29 colon cancer cells, a cell line that has been widely used for the study of many normal and neoplastic processes. A set of about 43,000 such images was used by Moffat et al. (Cell, 2006) to screen for mitotic regulators. The analysis followed the common pattern of identifying and counting cells with a phenotype of interest (in this case, cells that were in mitosis), then normalizing the count by dividing by the total number of cells. Such experiments present two image analysis problems. First, identifying the cells that have the phenotype of interest requires that the nuclei and cells be segmented. Second, normalizing requires an accurate cell count.

Since robust foreground/background separation and segmentation of cellular objects (i.e., identification of which pixels below to which objects) strongly depends on image quality, focus artifacts are detrimental to data quality. This image set provides examples of in- and out-of-focus HCS images which can be used for validation of focus metrics.

## LyNSeC: Lymphoma Nuclear Segmentation and Classification

Naji Hussein, Büttner Reinhard, Simon Adrian, Eich Marie-Lisa, Lohneis Philipp, Bozek Katarzyna

Published 2023-06-21

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Over the last years, there has been large progress in automated segmentation and classification methods in histological whole slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Current state-of-the-art techniques are based on diverse datasets of H&amp;E-stained WSIs of different types of predominantly solid cancer. However, there is a lack of publicly available annotated datasets of lymphoma, which is why we generated a labeled diffuse large B-cell lymphoma dataset and denoted it LyNSeC (lymphoma nuclear segmentation and classification). LyNSeC comprises three subsets: LyNSeC 1 consists of 379 IHC images of size 512 x 512 pixels at 40x magnification. In the images, we annotated the contours of each cell nuclei and the cell class: marker-positive or marker-negative.

In total, LyNSeC 1 contains 87,316 annotated cell nuclei of four different cases, with 48,171 of them assigned the class negative and 39,145 positive. We included three markers in this dataset showing visually different staining patterns: cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), Ki67 as a marker of proliferation, and erythroblast transformation-specific (EST)-related gene (ERG).

LyNSeC 2 and 3 contain H&amp;E-stained images of 70 different patients. LyNSeC 2 consists of 280 images and LyNSeC 3 of 40 images of size 512 x 512 pixels at 40x magnification. 65,479 and 8,452 nuclei were annotated in LyNSeC 2 and 3, respectively. In LyNSeC 3, the nuclei were also assigned a class label (tumor and non-tumor). 3,747 nuclei were identified as tumors and 4,705 as non-tumors.

In the annotation procedure, the contours of the H&amp;E images (LyNSeC 2 and LyNSeC 3) were annotated by two pathologists and by two students (trained by the pathologists). Annotation of the cell classes in LyNSeC 3 was done by the pathologists only. LyNSeC 1 was annotated by the two students who were additionally trained to annotate the contours and to distinguish marker-positive and marker-negative cells. The pathologists inspected and (if necessary) adjusted the LyNSeC 3 annotations.

The files are uploaded in &#39;.npy&#39; format. The files of LyNSeC 1 (x_l1.npy) and LyNSeC 3&nbsp;(x_l3.npy) contain five channels, respectively: the first three are the RGB channels of the images, channel 4 contains the instance maps, and channel 5 the class type maps (for LyNSeC 1 a pixel value of 1 corresponds to the class negative and 2 to the class positive, whereas in LyNSeC 3 1 corresponds to the class non-tumor and 2 to the class tumor). The files of LyNSeC 2 (x_l2.npy) have 4 channels (without the class type map).

Additionally, we also make our HoVer-Net-based pre-trained nuclei segmentation and classification models available (he.tar for H&amp;E images and ihc.tar for IHC images).

## Melanoma Histopathology Dataset with Tissue and Nuclei Annotations

Mark Schuiveling

Published 2025-03-19

Licensed CC-ZERO



Description:
This dataset is designed for development of deep learning models for segmentation of nuclei and tissue in melanoma H&amp;E stained histopathology. Existing nuclei segmentation models that are trained on non-melanoma specific datasets have low performance due to the ability of melanocytes to mimic other cell types, whereas existing melanoma specific models utilize older, sub-optimal techniques. Moreover, these models do not provide tissue annotations necessary for determining the localization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which may hold value for predictive and prognostic tasks. To address this, we created a melanoma specific dataset with nuclei and tissue annotations.&nbsp;
Methodology:
Sample Collection:
Regions of interest (ROIs) were sampled from H&amp;E stained slides of 103 primary melanoma specimens and 102 metastatic melanoma specimens, scanned using a Hamamatsu scanner at 40&times; magnification (0.23 &mu;m per pixel). All slides were obtained from regular diagnostic procedures.From each specimen, a 40&times; magnified ROI of 1024&times;1024 pixels was selected for annotation. Additionally, a context ROI of 5120&times;5120 pixels was sampled to provide information about the broader context for the annotation process. Selection was performed by a trained medical expert (M.S.) and subsequently verified by a dermatopathologist (W.B.). Manual ROI selection ensured the inclusion of diverse tissue and nuclei types.
Annotation Process:

Nuclei segmentationNuclei segmentations were generated using Hover-Net pretrained on the PanNuke dataset. Manual annotation adjustments were performed by author M.S. using QuPath, with the following nuclei categories: tumor, stroma, vascular endothelium, histiocyte, melanophage, lymphocyte, plasma cell, neutrophil, apoptotic cell, and epithelium. All annotations were reviewed and corrected, where needed, by a dermatopathologist (W.B.).
Tissue segmentationTissue segmentations were created manually using QuPath by M.S., with the following categories: tumor, stroma, epidermis, necrosis, blood vessel, and background. Annotations were reviewed and corrected, where needed, by a dermatopathologist (W.B.).

Quality Control: To assess the reliability of the annotations, intra- and interobserver agreement (by pathologist G.B.) were determined on 12 randomly selected ROIs.

Nuclei segmentationThe intraobserver overall precision was 84.89%, with a recall of 86.45%, and an F1 score of 85.66%. Interobserver overall precision was 80.34%, with a recall of 80.62%, and an F1 score of 80.20%. These results are based on the sum of all true positive, false positive, and false negative counts for the 12 ROIs.
Tissue segmentationThe DICE score was determined on the same 12 randomly selected ROIs. The average intraobserver DICE score was 0.90, and the interobserver DICE score was also 0.90.

&nbsp;
Version 3:Removed sample "training_set_metastatic_roi_103" due to inconsistencies in annotation file.
Version 4:Sample training_set_metastatic_roi_088 missed one color annotation for a nuclei_apoptosis in the geojson file rendering it qupath uncompatible. This is fixed in the new version.&nbsp;
Version 5:Addition of correct sample of training_set_metastatic_roi_103" after deadline of panoptic segmentation of nuclei and tissue in advanced melanoma challenge test phase.&nbsp;

The dataset for this challenge was obtained by carefully annotating tissue images of several patients with tumors of different organs and who were diagnosed at multiple hospitals. This dataset was created by downloading H&E stained tissue images captured at 40x magnification from TCGA archive. H&E staining is a routine protocol to enhance the contrast of a tissue section and is commonly used for tumor assessment (grading, staging, etc.). Given the diversity of nuclei appearances across multiple organs and patients, and the richness of staining protocols adopted at multiple hospitals, the training datatset will enable the development of robust and generalizable nuclei segmentation techniques that will work right out of the box.

Segmenting nuclei in 3D images can be challenging especially when nuclei are clustered not only in XY plane but also in XZ and YZ planes. Manually annotated ground truth provides a reference for image analysis software testing purposes. These images of mouse embryo blastocyst cells also have changing nuclei intensity in Z plane which makes finding the right threshold for successful segmentation a difficult task. This image set also contains GAPDH transcripts that can be quantified in each cell.

This is an instance segmentation task where each cell has an individual label under the same category (cells). The training set contains both labeled images and unlabeled images. You can only use the labeled images to develop your model but we encourage participants to try to explore the unlabeled images through weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning.
&nbsp;
The images are provided with original formats, including tiff, tif, png, jpg, bmp... The original formats contain the most amount of information for competitors and you have free choice over different normalization methods. For the ground truth, we standardize them as tiff formats.
&nbsp;
We aim to maintain this challenge as a sustainable benchmark platform. If you find the top algorithms (https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/awards/) don't perform well on your images, welcome to send us the dataset (neurips.cellseg@gmail.com)!

Abstract:
Staphylococcus aureus both colonizes humans and causes severe virulent infections. Virulence is regulated by the agr quorum sensing system and its autoinducing peptide (AIP), with dynamics at the single-cell level across four agr-types &ndash; each defined by distinct AIP sequences and capable of cross-inhibition &ndash; remaining elusive. Employing microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and deep-learning image analysis, we uncovered significant differences in AIP sensitivity among agr-types. We observed bimodal agr activation, attributed to intergenerational phenotypic stability and influenced by AIP concentration. Upon AIP stimulation, agr‑III showed AIP insensitivity, while agr‑II exhibited increased sensitivity and prolonged generation time. Beyond expected cross-inhibition of agr‑I by heterologous AIP‑II and ‑III, the presumably cross-activating AIP‑IV also inhibited agr‑I. Community interactions across different agr-type pairings revealed four main patterns: stable or switched dominance, and delayed or stable dual activation, influenced by community characteristics. These insights underscore the potential of personalized treatment strategies considering virulence and genetic diversity.

Dataset and StarDist model for the segmentation of Yersinia enterocolitica cells
This dataset and StarDist model are part of the publication "Active downregulation of the type III secretion system at higher local cell densities promotes Yersinia replication and dissemination".
It contains the dataset that was used for training the provided StarDist model using ZeroCostDL4Mic.
Data:
Yersinia enterocolitica cells were spotted on an agarose pad (1.5% low melting agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in minimal medium, 1% Casamino acids, 5 mM EGTA, &nbsp;glass depression slides (Marienfeld)). For imaging, a Deltavision Elite Optical Sectioning Microscope equipped with a UPlanSApo 100&times;/1.40 oil objective (Olympus) and an EDGE sCMOS_5.5 camera (Photometrics) was used. Z-stacks with 9 slices (∆z = 0.15 &micro;m) per fluorescence channel were acquired and &nbsp;5 slices were selected for network training. Images were annotated in Fiji using the Freehand selection tool, and brightlight and mask images were quartered to obtain the final dataset of 300 paired images. 260 images were used for training, while 40 images were used to test model performance.
Model:
The StarDist 2D model was trained from scratch for 100 epochs on 300 paired image patches (image dimensions: (480 x 480 px&sup2;), patch size: (480 x 480 px&sup2;)) with a batch size of 4 and a mae loss function, using the StarDist 2D ZeroCostDL4Mic notebook (v 1) (von Chamier &amp; Laine et al., 2020). Grid parameter was set to 2 and the number of rays to 120. The model was trained with an initial learning rate of 0.0003 using a 80/20 train/test split. The dataset was augmented 4-fold by flipping and rotation.
Key python packages used include tensorflow (v 0.1.12), Keras (v2.3.1), csbdeep (v 0.7.2), numpy (v 1.21.6), cuda (v 11.1.105Build cuda_11.1.TC455_06.29190527_0). The training was accelerated using a Tesla T4 GPU.

## SynapseNet Training Data

Published 2024-12-01

This dataset contains room-temperature single-axis TEM tomograms from Schaffer collateral and mossy fiber synapses in organotypic hippocampal slices.&nbsp;The tomograms were published in the two studies [1, 2]. The data was re-used for training deep neural networks to segment different synaptic structures in electron micrographs in [3].&nbsp;For the tomograms, organotypic slices were prepared from the hippocampi of neonatal mice according to the interface protocol55 and vitrified after 28 days in vitro in culture medium supplemented with 20% (w/v) bovine serum albumin using an HPM100 (Leica) high-pressure freezing device. The dataset also contains 23 tomograms resulting from chemically-fixed material, which were also published in (Maus et al., 2020). For these tomograms, wild-type animals at postnatal day 28 were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia, first with 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and then one of two fixatives (Fixative 1: Ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer16; Fixative 2: 37&deg; C 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2 mM CaCl2, in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer56). Brains were rinsed and sectioned coronally through the dorsal hippocampus in an ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer using a VT 1200S vibratome (Leica) (step size 100 &micro;m; amplitude 1.5 mm, speed 0.1 mm/sec). Hippocampal CA3 subregions were excised using a 1.5 mm diameter biopsy punch and high-pressure frozen on the same day in 20% (w/v) bovine serum albumin using an HPM100 (Leica) high-pressure freezing device. For both sample preparations, automated freeze-substitution was performed. Tomograms were collected using a 200 kV JEM-2100 (JEOL) transmission electron microscope equipped with an 11 MP Orius SC1000 CCD camera (Gatan). Tilt-series (tilt range +/- 60&deg;; 1&deg; angular increments) were acquired at 30 000x magnification using SerialEM58. Tomographic reconstructions were generated using weighted back-projection with etomo.The data is organized into two different subfolders for data with annotations for "vesicles" and "active_zones". Each of these subfolders is further subdivided into "train" and "test" folders, which containtomograms for the two different sample preparations in "chemical_fixation" and "single_axis_tem".Each tomogram and the corresponding annotation is stored as a hdf5 file, containing the following internal datasets:- raw: The tomogram data.- labels/vesicles: Annotations for the synaptic vesicles, annotated with IMOD, further postprocessed and then exported to instance masks. (for tomograms in "vesicles")- labels/AZ: Annotations for the active zone, annotated with IMOD and exported to binary masks.

Involves an annotated large number of cells, including normal epithelial and myoepithelial breast cells (localized in ducts and lobules), invasive carcinomatous cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, macrophages and inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and plasmocytes). In total, our data set consists of 50 images with a total of 4022 annotated cells, the maximum number of cells in one sample is 293 and the minimum number of cells in one sample is 5, with an average of 80 cells per sample and a high standard deviation of 58. The annotation was performed by three experts: an expert pathologist and two trained research fellows. Each sample was annotated by one of the annotators, checked by another one and in case of disagreement, a consensus was established by discussion among the 3 experts.
