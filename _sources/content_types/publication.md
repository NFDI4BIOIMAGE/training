Published 2023-09-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



The lifecycle of scientific tools comprises the creation of code releases, packages and containers which can be deployed into cloud platforms, such as the Galaxy Project, where they are run and integrated into workflows. The tools and workflows are further used to create training material that benefits a broad community. The need to organize and streamline this tool development lifecycle has led to a sophisticated development and deployment architecture.

Coordinated collaboration is essential to realize the added value of and infrastructure requirements for global image data sharing in the life sciences. In this White Paper, we take a first step at presenting some of the most common use cases as well as critical/emerging use cases of (including the use of artificial intelligence for) biological and medical image data, which would benefit tremendously from better frameworks for sharing (including technical, resourcing, legal, and ethical aspects).

Together with the molecular knowledge of genes and proteins, biological images promise to significantly enhance the scientific understanding of complex cellular systems and to advance predictive and personalized therapeutic products for human health. For this potential to be realized, quality-assured image data must be shared among labs at a global scale to be compared, pooled, and reanalyzed, thus unleashing untold potential beyond the original purpose for which the data was generated.

## Insights and Impact From Five Cycles of Essential Open Source Software for Science

Kate Hertweck, Carly Strasser, Dario Taraborelli

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Open source software (OSS) is essential for advancing scientific discovery, particularly in biomedical research, yet funding to support these vital tools has been limited. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program has significantly contributed to this field by providing $51.8 million in funding over five years to support the maintenance, growth, and community engagement of critical OSS tools. The program has impacted scientific OSS projects by improving their technical outputs, community building, and sustainability practices, and fostering collaborations within the OSS community. Additionally, EOSS funding has enhanced diversity, equity, and inclusion within the OSS community, although changes in principal investigator demographics were not observed. The funded projects have had a substantial impact on biomedical research by improving the usability and accessibility of scientific software, which has led to increased adoption and advancements in various biomedical fields.

## Modeling community standards for metadata as templates makes data FAIR

Mark A Musen, Martin J O'Connor, Erik Schultes, Marcos Martínez-Romero, Josef Hardi, John Graybeal

Published 2022-11-12

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



The authors have developed a model for scientific metadata, and they have made that model usable by both CEDAR and FAIRware. The approach shows that a formal metadata model can standardize reporting guidelines and that it can enable separate software systems to assist (1) in the authoring of standards-adherent metadata and (2) in the evaluation of existing metadata.

Bioimage analysis (BIA), a crucial discipline in biological research, overcomes the limitations of subjective analysis in microscopy through the creation and application of quantitative and reproducible methods. The establishment of dedicated BIA support within academic institutions is vital to improving research quality and efficiency and can significantly advance scientific discovery. However, a lack of training resources, limited career paths and insufficient recognition of the contributions made by bioimage analysts prevent the full realization of this potential. This Perspective – the result of the recent The Company of Biologists Workshop ‘Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis’, which aimed to summarize the global BIA landscape, categorize obstacles and offer possible solutions – proposes strategies to bring about a cultural shift towards recognizing the value of BIA by standardizing tools, improving training and encouraging formal credit for contributions

## Zarr - A Cloud-Optimized Storage for Interactive Access of Large Arrays

Josh Moore, Susanne Kunis

Published 2023-09-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



For decades, the sharing of large N-dimensional datasets has posed issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or down-sampled representations on the fly. Now, a cloud-native chunked format easing this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The format — Zarr — is potentially of interest for other consortia and sections of NFDI.
