## Cultivating Open Training

Robert Haase

Licensed cc-by-4.0



In these slides introduce current challenges and potential solutions for openly sharing training materials, softly focusing on bio-image analysis. In this field a lot of training materials circulate in private channels, but openly shared, reusable materials, according to the FAIR-principles, are still rare. Using the CC-BY license and publicly acessible repositories are proposed to fill this gap.

## FAIRy deep-learning for bioImage analysis

Estibaliz Gómez de Mariscal

Licensed CC-BY 4.0



Introduction to FAIR deep learning. Furthermore, tools to deploy trained DL models (deepImageJ), easily train and evaluate them (ZeroCostDL4Mic and DeepBacs) ensure reproducibility (DL4MicEverywhere), and share this technology in an open-source and reproducible manner (BioImage Model Zoo) are introduced.
