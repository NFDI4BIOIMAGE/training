## Euro-BioImaging's Template for Research Data Management Plans

['Isabel Kemmer', 'Euro-BioImaging ERIC']

Published 2024-06-04

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Euro-BioImaging has developed a Data Management Plan (DMP) template with questions tailored to bioimaging research projects. Outlining data management practices in this way ensures traceability of project data, allowing for a continuous and unambiguous flow of information throughout the research project. This template can be used to satisfy the requirement to submit a DMP to certain funders. Regardless of the funder, Euro-BioImaging users are encouraged to provide a DMP and can use this template accordingly.&nbsp;
This DMP template is available as a fillable PDF with further instructions and sample responses available by hovering over the fillable fields.&nbsp;
