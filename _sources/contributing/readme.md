# How to contribute

This repository contains lists of training materials. It is extensible using github pull requests. Just go to the list of resources, click the edit button, add a resource you think should be in the list and go ahead and submit it as pull-request. The format for entries in the repository is documented on the next page.

## Inclusion criteria

We will consider merging links to all materials which are educative. This can be online tutorials like videos, written tutorials, blog posts and publications.

## Exclusion criteria

We will not merge links to materials which are located behind a paywall. We will also not merge links to materials which serve mostly advertising products such as commercial software. However, if there are openly accessible training resources for commercial software, we welcome links to these resources.

## Step-by-step tutorial

If you want to contribute a new link to some training materials, got to the yml file, e.g. to [events.yml](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/training/blob/main/resources/events.yml) and click the `edit` button.

Save the file and enter a meaningful commit message. Write what you added to the file in very short.

After submitting the pull-request, wait for a second while the tests are running.

Wait until the tests have passed. If they don't, check the error message and modify the file on your branch again until the tests pass. If the error is not related to your changes, please let us know and we will take care of it.
