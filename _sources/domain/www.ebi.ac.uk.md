This dataset is the training set with annotations for the SELMA3D challenge. The SELMA3D challenge focuses on self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation. Its objective is to encourage the development of self-supervised learning methods for general segmentation of various structures in 3D light-sheet microscopy images. The dataset comtains 3D image patches of different labeled biological structures in the brain, including blood vessels, c-Fos labeled brain cells involved in neural activity, cell nuclei, and Alzheimers disease plaques. Each patch includes corresponding pixel-wise annotations for the labeled structures.

Licensed CC0-1.0



We present computational tools that allow versatile and accurate 3D nuclear segmentation in plant organs, enable the analysis of cell-nucleus geometric relationships, and improve the accuracy of 3D cell segmentation. This biostudies submission includes Arabidopsis ovule model training dataset used in the study. The training dataset is composed of strong and weak nuclei image channels, corresponding ground truth segmentation, cell wall image and associated cell segmentation mentioned in the study. Trained models from the study, a total of 47 trained models are made available from this study. This included 15 initial models, 30 gold models, and 2 platinum models. Models were trained using PlantSeg, Stardist and Cellpose. All image datasets and its segmentation as part of the figures in this study is also available as separate zip files. This includes image dataset from different species and organs as listed below.

One of the principal challenges in counting or segmenting nuclei is dealing with clustered nuclei. To help assess algorithms performance in this regard, this synthetic image set consists of four subsets with increasing degree of clustering. Each subset is also provided in two different levels of quality: high SNR and low SNR.
