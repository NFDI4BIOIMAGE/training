## Dr Guillaume Jacquemet on studying cancer cell metastasis in the era of deep learning for microscopy

Guillaume Jacquemet

Published 2024-10-24

Licensed UNKNOWN



Leukocyte extravasation is a critical component of the innate immune response, while circulating tumour cell extravasation is a crucial step in metastasis formation. Despite their importance, these extravasation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this talk, Guillaume Jacquemet presents a novel imaging framework that integrates microfluidics with high-speed, label-free imaging to study the arrest of pancreatic cancer cells (PDAC) on human endothelial layers under physiological flow conditions.

## I3D:bio's OMERO training material: Re-usable, adjustable, multi-purpose slides for local user training

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.
