The DALIA (Data Literacy Alliance) project aims to develop a knowledge graph for FAIR teaching and learning materials on data literacy, data competencies and research data management (RDM) skills within the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and the RDM landscape. Such a platform thrives on the participation of users who want to search, create, manage or use teaching and learning materials.
A schematization of the metadata is necessary for the interoperability of teaching and learning materials. This is done by the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF), which provides a framework for making the metadata of teaching and learning materials transparent, comparable and smooth to integrate into the DALIA platform. It includes the description and explanation of the data fields for the online publication of educational resources.
The DIF was developed in close consultation with the scientific community. This development process included several feedback rounds in which valuable feedback was provided and subsequently incorporated into the DIF. This not only contributed to the clear, transparent and user-oriented definitions of the data fields, and to a clear structure, but also to the integration of many existing data standards and to the (special) requirements of the scientific community. The selection of elements is based on the&nbsp;Dublin Core Application Profile.
The DIF is provided as a PDF document and in table form (ODS) to convey the attributes of the teaching and learning materials and their definitions in an easily understandable form and to facilitate communication. It also includes a legend and an example in tabular form. In addition, a template (CSV) with the attributes as column headers is provided, which can be used for recording the metadata of the teaching and learning materials. The tables can also be transferred to technical application profiles.
We would like to thank all the commentators of the previous versions, especially Susanne Arndt, Sophie Bo&szlig;e, Sonja Felder, Marc Fuhrmans, Jan-Michael Haugwitz, Marina Lemaire, Karoline Lemke, Birte Lindst&auml;dt, Juliane R&ouml;der, and Jakob Vo&szlig;. Without their feedback and advice, the DIF would be less transparent.
