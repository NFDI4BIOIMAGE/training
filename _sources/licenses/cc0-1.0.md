## Galaxy workflows

Licensed CC0-1.0



A workflow is a chain of analysis steps. In Galaxy, we can create a workflow from an existing analysis history, or we can create one visually by adding tools to a canvas. This tutorial covers building a workflow to analyse a bacterial genome, from input FASTQ sequencing reads to assembly, annotation, and visualization.

## Statistical Rethinking

Richard McElreath

Published 2024-03-01

Licensed CC0-1.0



This course teaches data analysis, but it focuses on scientific models. The unfortunate truth about data is that nothing much can be done with it, until we say what caused it. We will prioritize conceptual, causal models and precise questions about those models. We will use Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence. And we will learn powerful computational tools for coping with high-dimension, imperfect data of the kind that biologists and social scientists face.
