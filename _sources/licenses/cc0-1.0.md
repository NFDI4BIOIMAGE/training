## Drosophila Kc167 cells

Vebjorn Ljosa, Katherine L. Sokolnicki, Anne E. Carpenter

Published 2012-06-28

Licensed CC0-1.0



Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 cells were stained for DNA (to label nuclei) and actin (a cytoskeletal protein, to show the cell body). Automatic cytometry requires that cells be segmented, i.e., that the pixels belonging to each cell be identified. Because segmenting nuclei and distinguishing foreground from background is comparatively easy for these images, the focus here is on finding the boundaries between adjacent cells.

## Galaxy workflows

Licensed CC0-1.0



A workflow is a chain of analysis steps. In Galaxy, we can create a workflow from an existing analysis history, or we can create one visually by adding tools to a canvas. This tutorial covers building a workflow to analyse a bacterial genome, from input FASTQ sequencing reads to assembly, annotation, and visualization.

Published 2024-06-29

Licensed CC0-1.0



We present computational tools that allow versatile and accurate 3D nuclear segmentation in plant organs, enable the analysis of cell-nucleus geometric relationships, and improve the accuracy of 3D cell segmentation. This biostudies submission includes Arabidopsis ovule model training dataset used in the study. The training dataset is composed of strong and weak nuclei image channels, corresponding ground truth segmentation, cell wall image and associated cell segmentation mentioned in the study. Trained models from the study, a total of 47 trained models are made available from this study. This included 15 initial models, 30 gold models, and 2 platinum models. Models were trained using PlantSeg, Stardist and Cellpose. All image datasets and its segmentation as part of the figures in this study is also available as separate zip files. This includes image dataset from different species and organs as listed below.

## Human U2OS cells (out of focus)

Licensed CC0-1.0



Since robust foreground/background separation and segmentation of cellular objects (i.e., identification of which pixels below to which objects) strongly depends on image quality, focus artifacts are detrimental to data quality. This image set provides examples of in- and out-of-focus HCS images which can be used for validation of focus metrics.

## Mouse embryo blastocyst cells

Vebjorn Ljosa, Katherine L. Sokolnicki, Anne E. Carpenter

Published 2012-06-28

Licensed CC0-1.0



Segmenting nuclei in 3D images can be challenging especially when nuclei are clustered not only in XY plane but also in XZ and YZ planes. Manually annotated ground truth provides a reference for image analysis software testing purposes. These images of mouse embryo blastocyst cells also have changing nuclei intensity in Z plane which makes finding the right threshold for successful segmentation a difficult task. This image set also contains GAPDH transcripts that can be quantified in each cell.

## Nuclei of U2OS cells in a chemical screen

Vebjorn Ljosa, Katherine L. Sokolnicki, Anne E. Carpenter

Published 2012-06-28

Licensed CC0-1.0



This image set is part of a high-throughput chemical screen on U2OS cells, with examples of 200 bioactive compounds. The effect of the treatments was originally imaged using the Cell Painting assay (fluorescence microscopy). This data set only includes the DNA channel of a single field of view per compound. These images present a variety of nuclear phenotypes, representative of high-throughput chemical perturbations. The main use of this data set is the study of segmentation algorithms that can separate individual nucleus instances in an accurate way, regardless of their shape and cell density. The collection has around 23,000 single nuclei manually annotated to establish a ground truth collection for segmentation evaluation.

## Nuclei of mouse embryonic cells

Published 2012-06-28

Licensed CC0-1.0



Cell dynamics during the early mouse embryogenesis change spatiotemporally. For understanding the mechanism of this developmental process, imaging cell dynamics by live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled nuclei and performing nuclei segmentation of these images by image processing are essential. This dataset contains the fluorescence images and Ground Truth used when performing nuclei segmentation using deep learning. Fluorescence images are time-series images from fertilization to blastocyst formation. Ground Truth is supervised data of the cell nuclear region.

Licensed CC0-1.0



These are synthetic images from the Cell Tracking Challenge. The images depict simulated nuclei of HL60 cells stained with Hoescht (training datasets). These synthetic images of HL60 cells provide an opportunity to test image analysis software by comparing segmentation results to the available ground truth for each time point. The number of clustered nuclei increases with time adding more complexity to the problem. This time-laps dataset can be used for simple segmentation or for nuclei tracking.

## Statistical Rethinking

Richard McElreath

Published 2024-03-01

Licensed CC0-1.0



This course teaches data analysis, but it focuses on scientific models. The unfortunate truth about data is that nothing much can be done with it, until we say what caused it. We will prioritize conceptual, causal models and precise questions about those models. We will use Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence. And we will learn powerful computational tools for coping with high-dimension, imperfect data of the kind that biologists and social scientists face.
