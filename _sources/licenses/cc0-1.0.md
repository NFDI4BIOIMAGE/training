## Galaxy workflows

Licensed CC0-1.0



A workflow is a chain of analysis steps. In Galaxy, we can create a workflow from an existing analysis history, or we can create one visually by adding tools to a canvas. This tutorial covers building a workflow to analyse a bacterial genome, from input FASTQ sequencing reads to assembly, annotation, and visualization.
