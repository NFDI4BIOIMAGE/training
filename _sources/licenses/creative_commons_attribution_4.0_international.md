Interdisciplinary collaboration and integrating large, diverse datasets are crucial for answering complex research questions, requiring multimodal data analysis and adherence to FAIR principles. To address challenges in capturing the full research cycle and contextualizing data, DataPLANT developed the Annotated Research Context (ARC), while the neuroimaging community extended the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for microscopic image data, both providing standardized, file system-based storage structures for organizing and sharing data with metadata.

Licensed Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International



High-content screening (HCS) bioimaging automates the imaging and analysis of numerous biological samples, generating extensive metadata that is crucial for effective image management and interpretation. Efficiently handling this complex data is essential to implementing FAIR principles and realizing HCS's full potential for scientific discoveries.

Photonic data analysis, combining imaging, spectroscopy, machine learning, and computer science, requires flexible methods and interdisciplinary collaborations to advance. Essential developments include standardizing data infrastructure for comparability, optimizing data-driven models for complex investigations, and creating techniques to handle limited or unbalanced data and device variations.

## RDF as a bridge to domain-platforms like OMERO, or There and back again.

['Moore, Josh', 'Waagmeester, Andra', 'Hettne, Kristina', 'Wolstencroft, Katherine', 'Kunis, Susanne']

Licensed Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International



In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However, just a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the development of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes it possible to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot immediately be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering the benefit of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

## [CORDI 2023] Zarr: A Cloud-Optimized Storage for Interactive Access of Large Arrays

Josh Moore

Licensed Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International



For decades, the sharing of large N-dimensional datasets has posed issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or down-sampled representations on the fly. Now, a cloud-native chunked format easing this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The format — Zarr — is potentially of interest for other consortia and sections of NFDI.

Poster presented at Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Health Care and Life Sciences (SWAT4HCLS 2023), Feb 13--16, 2023, Basel, Switzerland. NFDI4BIOIMAGE is a newly established German consortium dedicated to the FAIR representation of biological imaging data. A key deliverable is the definition of a semantically-compatible FAIR image object integrating RDF metadata with web-compatible storage of large n-dimensional binary data in OME-Zarr. We invite feedback from and collaboration with other endeavors during the soon-to-begin 5 year funding period.

How to optimize microscopy data management using structured metadata annotations in OMERO, facilitating organization for processing, analysis, and eventual publication. The focus lies on enhancing data findability and usability through object-oriented organization, integrating OMERO with ImageJ/Fiji for image analysis, and implementing community-accepted metadata standards like REMBI to ensure data reproducibility and reusability.
