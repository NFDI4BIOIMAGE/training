Licensed UNKNOWN



The ARC is a framework for organizing and documenting research data, as well as a container that continuously supports collaboration, data exchange, and adherence to FAIR principles among various researchers. The ARC can be checked for completeness and quality at any time and converted into a citable data publication without interrupting the research or documentation process. It is built on widely accepted research data standards such as RO-Crate, ISA, and abstract CWL.

## Dr Guillaume Jacquemet on studying cancer cell metastasis in the era of deep learning for microscopy

Guillaume Jacquemet

Published 2024-10-24

Licensed UNKNOWN



Leukocyte extravasation is a critical component of the innate immune response, while circulating tumour cell extravasation is a crucial step in metastasis formation. Despite their importance, these extravasation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this talk, Guillaume Jacquemet presents a novel imaging framework that integrates microfluidics with high-speed, label-free imaging to study the arrest of pancreatic cancer cells (PDAC) on human endothelial layers under physiological flow conditions.
