# NFDI4BioImage Training Materials

This Jupyter Book contains links to training materials in the context Bio-image Analysis and Research Data Management for Microscopy Data.

This is a **preliminary** search index allowing us to explore how such a database could look like. We follow the principle _release early, release often_ and aim at having a functional prototype of the database at any time. We use this resource to 
* explore what kind of meta-data we need to collect for training materials
* which other online resources exist providing links to training materials
* how we can automatically collect links to training materials
* how we could potentially inject our list of materials into the other resources
* how to collect links to training materials following the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)

Feedback and contributions are very welcome.

## How to use this resource
