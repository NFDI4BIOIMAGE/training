# NFDI4BioImage Training Materials

This Jupyter Book contains 117 links to training materials in the context Research Data Management for Bioimaging / Microscopy Data and Bio-image Analysis and has been updated 2023-10-14.

This is a **preliminary** / **experimental** search index allowing us to explore how such a database could look like. We follow the principle [_release early, release often_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) and aim at having a functional prototype of the search index at any time. We will use this resource to 
* explore what kind of meta-data we need to collect for training materials
* which other online resources exist providing links to training materials
* how we can automatically collect links to training materials
* how we could potentially inject our list of materials into the other resources
* how to collect links to training materials following the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)

Feedback and contributions are very welcome, e.g. as [github issue](https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/training/issues).
