Published 2024-10-09

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In this presentation I introduce bia-bob, an AI-based code generator that integrates into Jupyter Lab and allows for easy generation of Bio-Image Analysis Python code. It highlights how to get started with using large language models and prompt engineering to get high-quality bio-image analysis code.

## Bio-image Analysis with the Help of Large Language Models

Robert Haase

Published 2024-03-13

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Large Language Models (LLMs) change the way how we use computers. This also has impact on the bio-image analysis community. We can generate code that analyzes biomedical image data if we ask the right prompts. This talk outlines introduces basic principles, explains prompt engineering and how to apply it to bio-image analysis. We also compare how different LLM vendors perform on code generation tasks and which challenges are ahead for the bio-image analysis community.

## Dr Guillaume Jacquemet on studying cancer cell metastasis in the era of deep learning for microscopy

Guillaume Jacquemet

Published 2024-10-24

Licensed UNKNOWN



Leukocyte extravasation is a critical component of the innate immune response, while circulating tumour cell extravasation is a crucial step in metastasis formation. Despite their importance, these extravasation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this talk, Guillaume Jacquemet presents a novel imaging framework that integrates microfluidics with high-speed, label-free imaging to study the arrest of pancreatic cancer cells (PDAC) on human endothelial layers under physiological flow conditions.
