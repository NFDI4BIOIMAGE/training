## Dr Guillaume Jacquemet on studying cancer cell metastasis in the era of deep learning for microscopy

Guillaume Jacquemet

Published 2024-10-24

Licensed UNKNOWN



Leukocyte extravasation is a critical component of the innate immune response, while circulating tumour cell extravasation is a crucial step in metastasis formation. Despite their importance, these extravasation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this talk, Guillaume Jacquemet presents a novel imaging framework that integrates microfluidics with high-speed, label-free imaging to study the arrest of pancreatic cancer cells (PDAC) on human endothelial layers under physiological flow conditions.

## FAIRy deep-learning for bioImage analysis

Estibaliz Gómez de Mariscal

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Introduction to FAIR deep learning. Furthermore, tools to deploy trained DL models (deepImageJ), easily train and evaluate them (ZeroCostDL4Mic and DeepBacs) ensure reproducibility (DL4MicEverywhere), and share this technology in an open-source and reproducible manner (BioImage Model Zoo) are introduced.
