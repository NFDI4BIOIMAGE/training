.lif files misbehaving in fiji but fine in LASX.&nbsp; This data opens fine in LASX but FIJI only likes some of the files.&nbsp; I think it was captured during a poweroutage so may have lived on a temp drive and been recovered when the power came back.&nbsp; LASX uses the .lifext but I don't think FIJI does.&nbsp; I have included it however since it is part of the dataset output from the microscope.

One of the principal challenges in counting or segmenting nuclei is dealing with clustered nuclei. To help assess algorithms performance in this regard, this synthetic image set consists of four subsets with increasing degree of clustering. Each subset is also provided in two diferent levels of quality: high SNR and low SNR.

## 3D Nuclei annotations and StarDist 3D model(s) (rat brain)

Romain Guiet

Published 2022-06-15

Name: 3D Nuclei annotations and StarDist3D model(s) (rat brain)

Images:&nbsp;&nbsp;From a large tiling acquisition ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6646128 ) individual Tile (xyz : 1024x1024x62) were downsampled and cropped (128x128x62). Four crops, from different tiles (./annotations_BIOP/images/) were manually annotated with ITK-SNAP (./annotations_BIOP/masks/)

These four images, and their corresponding masks, were cropped into four quadrants (./crops_BIOP_v1/) in order to get 16 different images (64x64x62).

Conda environment:&nbsp;A conda environment was created using the yml file &nbsp;stardist0.8_TF1.15.yml

Training :&nbsp;Training was performed using the jupyter notebook 1-Training_notebook.ipynb.
Three different trainings (with the same random seed, same anisotropy, patch size and grid) were performed and produced three different models (./models/)

Validation images (from the random seed used) were exported to ease the visual inspection of the results(./val_rdm42/).

Validation:&nbsp;&nbsp;To save metrics in a csv file and compare predictions to the annotations the jupyter notebook 2-QC_notebook.ipynb can be used on the validation folder.

Large images: To test the model on larger images one can use Whole_ds441.tif (or Crop_ds441.tif )
These images were obtained using the plugin BigSticher on the raw data ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6646128 ), resaved as h5 and exported the downsample&nbsp;by 4 version.

Published 2022-06-17

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Here we present a benchmarking dataset of fluorescence microscopy images with Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei together with annotations of nuclei, nuclear fragments and micronuclei. Images were randomly selected from an RNA interference screen with a modified U2OS osteosarcoma cell line, acquired on a Thermo Fischer CX7 high-content imaging system at 20x magnification. Labelling was performed by a single annotator and reviewed by a biomedical expert.

The dataset contains 50 images showing over 2000 labelled nuclear objects in total, which is sufficiently large to train well-performing neural networks for instance or semantic segmentation. It is pre-split into training, development and test set, each in a zip file. The dataset should be referred to as Aitslab_bioimaging1. A brief article describing the dataset is also available (Arvidsson M, Kazemi Rashed S, Aits S. 10.1016/j.dib.2022.108769 )

## Assessment of Residual Breast Cancer Cellularity after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy using Digital Pathology

Mohammad Peikari, Sherine Salama, Sharon Nofech-Mozes, Anne L. Martel

Published 2017-10-04

Licensed CC-BY-3.0



Breast cancer (BC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S. with more than 250,000 new cases of invasive breast cancers reported in 2017. The majority of women with locally advanced and a subset of patients with operable breast cancer will undergo systemic therapy prior to their surgery (neoadjuvant therapy/ NAT) to reduce the size of tumor(s) and possibly further undergo breast conserving surgery. The Post-NAT-BRCA dataset is a collection of representative sections from breast resections in patients with residual invasive BC following NAT. Histologic sections were prepared and digitized to produce high resolution, microscopic images of treated BC tumors. Also included, are clinical features and expert pathology annotations of tumor cellularity and cell types. The Residual Cancer Burden Index (RCBi), is a clinically validated tool for assessment of response to NAT associated with prognosis. Tumor cellularity is one of the parameters used for calculating the RCBi. In this dataset, tumor cellularity refers to a measure of residual disease after NAT, in the form of proportion of malignant tumor inside the tumor bed region; also annotated. (See MD Anderson RCB Calculator for a detailed description of tumor cellularity.) Malignant, healthy, lymphocyte and other labels were also provided for individual cells to aid development of cell segmentation algorithms.

## Automatic labelling of HeLa "Kyoto" cells using Deep Learning tools

Romain Guiet

Published 2022-02-25

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Name: Automatic labelling&nbsp;of HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells using Deep Learning tools

Data type: Microscopy images from the dataset &ldquo;HeLa &ldquo;Kyoto&rdquo; cells&nbsp;under the scope&rdquo;, Brightfield (BF), Digital Phase Contrast (DPC, either &ldquo;raw&rdquo; or &ldquo;square-rooted&rdquo;), Tubulin and H2B fluorescent channel, paired with their corresponding nuclei or cell/cyto label images.

Labels images: Labels images were generated using the script &ldquo;prepare_trainingDataset_cellpose.ijm&rdquo;.

Briefly, for 5 defined time-points (1,10,50,100,150), channels of interest were duplicated, resaved and :

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nuclei label images were obtained using StarDist on H2B channel

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cell label images were obtained using Cellpose on Tubulin and H2B channels

A quick visual inspection of the resulting label images concluded that they were satisfying enough, despite certainly not being perfect.

Notes :

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This labelling&nbsp;strategy:

o&nbsp;&nbsp; will not produce 100% accurate labels, but they might be more reproducible than labels generated by humans and are (definitely) much faster to obtain.

o&nbsp;&nbsp; is NOT a recommended way of generating labels images, but for educational purposes.

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fluorescent channels are part of the dataset to ease the process of review of the labels and are NOT used for training. We generated the labels from the fluorescent channels to later predict labels from the BF or DPC channels only. As such, the fluorescent channels should not be &ldquo;reused&rdquo; with our labels during training.

File format: .tif (16-bit)

Image size: 540x540 (Pixel size: 0.299 nm)

## Axioscan 7 fluorescent channels not displaying in QuPath

j

Published 2024-06-25



Hi&nbsp;@ome team,Please find the .czi file attached. When loaded into QuPath using BioFormats, the fluorescence channels populate the brightness/contrast panel but do not show up in the viewer. Re-exporting as OME.Tiff from Zen and loading into QuPath does not help either - the channels do not populate the brightness/contrast panel in this case, and it shows as a RGB image.Please let me know if any further info is needed from me to troubleshoot!
Best,J

## Bioimaging workflow based on OMERO, eLabFTW, and Adamant for integrating images with multimodal metadata

Mohsen Ahmadi, Robert Wagner, Sander Bekeschus, Becker, Markus M.

Published 2025-07-29

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This research data management workflow for bioimaging is designed to bridge the gap between image metadata and experimental / process metadata. By linking images and microscopy-related metadata with broader experimental records, the workflow particularly supports the adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in interdisciplinary fields where bioimaging is used to analyse treated samples requiring multimodal metadata. A Jupyter Notebook guides the user through the metadata level, data handling level, and data processing level and connects various software components in a modular manner. On the metadata level, microscope-specific metadata are captured using the Micro-Meta App and stored as reusable digital assets. Adamant provides a user interface to collect and process schema-based metadata related to the experiment / treatment procedure. Structured imaging and process metadata are attached to the complete experiment description in eLabFTW. On the data handling level, OMERO serves as the central platform for storing and managing microscopy images together with their metadata retrieved from eLabFTW (workflow with ELN) or directly from JSON files (workflow without ELN). On the data processing level, OMERO supports both automated and manual image analysis either directly via the Jupyter Notebook or FIJI. Due to the modularity of the workflow, the integrated tools can be substituted with equivalent systems based on institutional / user requirements. Whether in teaching or research settings, this workflow supports high-throughput, reproducible imaging workflows, ensuring that data, metadata, and analysis steps remain transparent, interoperable, and reusable across diverse bioimage analysis platforms.

## Building FAIR image analysis pipelines for high-content-screening (HCS) data using Galaxy

Riccardo Massei, Matthias Berndt, Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Wibke Busch, Stefan Scholz, Hannes Bohring, Jo Nyffeler, Luise Reger, Jan Bumberger, Lucille Lopez-Delisle

Published 2024-11-06

Imaging is crucial across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences, where it plays a key role in studies ranging from single molecules to whole organisms. However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data, especially from high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms, present significant challenges. Managing and analysing this data efficiently requires well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR principles&mdash;ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable across different domains.
In the frame of NFDI4BioImaging (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing, analysing, and sharing HCS data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to make findable and machine-readable metadata using (semi)automatic analysis pipelines. In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity, supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata.
Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis. By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases the efficiency of HCS bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific community's efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation.
In the present study, we proposed an automated analysis pipeline for storing, processing, analysing, and sharing HCS bioimaging data. The (semi)automatic workflow was developed by taking as a case study a dataset of zebrafish larvae and cell lines images previously obtained from an automated imaging system generating data in an HCS fashion. In our workflows, images are automatically enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to the UFZ-OME Remote Objects (OMERO) server using a novel OMERO tool suite developed with GALAXY. Workflows give the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and perform image analysis (i.e. annotation) or even more complex toxicological analyses (dose response modelling). Furthermore, we want to improve the FAIRness of the protocol by adding a direct upload link to the Image Data Resource (IDR) repository to automatically prepare the data for publication and sharing.

## Cloud-Based Virtual Desktops for Reproducible Research

Yi Sun, Christian Tischer, Kelleher, Harry Alexander, Jean-Karim Heriche

Published 2025-09-10

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Reproducing computing environments become increasingly challenging in research, especially when compute-intensive scientific workflows require specialised software stacks, specialized hardware (e.g. GPUs), and interactive analysis tools. While traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems offer scalable resources for batch processing, they don't easily support interactive workflows. On the other hand, workstations have fixed resources  and face workflow deployment challenges because conflicts can occur when multiple tools and dependencies are deployed into the same environment. To address these limitations, we present cloud-based virtual desktop platforms, built on the desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) model, using a containerised, cloud-native approach.  Our platforms offer on-demand, customized desktop environments accessible from any web browser, with dynamic allocation of CPU, memory, and GPU resources for efficient utilization of resources. We introduce two types of virtual desktops: BAND, built on top of a Slurm scheduler and BARD, using Kubernetes. In both cases, containerization ensures consistent and reproducible environments across sessions and pre-installed software improves accessibility for researchers. Deployment and system administration are also simplified through the use of orchestration and automation tools.  Our virtual desktop platforms are particularly valuable for bioimage analysis, which requires complex workflows involving high interactivity, multiple software and GPU acceleration. By combining containerization and cloud-native services, BAND and BARD offer a scalable and sustainable model for delivering interactive, reproducible research environments.

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows researchers to image cells in their native, hydrated state at the highest resolution currently possible. However, the technique has several limitations that make analyzing the data it generates time-intensive and difficult. Hand-segmenting a single tomogram can take hours to days of human effort, but the microscope can easily generate 50 or more tomograms a day. Current deep learning segmentation programs for cryo-ET do exist but are limited to segmenting one structure at a time. Here multi-slice U-Net convolutional neural networks are trained and applied to automatically segment multiple structures simultaneously within cryo-tomograms. With proper preprocessing, these networks can be robustly inferred to many tomograms without the need for training individual networks for each tomogram. This workflow dramatically improves the speed with which cryo-electron tomograms can be analyzed by cutting segmentation time down to under 30 min in most cases. Further, segmentations can be used to improve the accuracy of filament tracing within a cellular context and to rapidly extract coordinates for subtomogram averaging.

A novel contour-based approach to cell detection and segmentation has been developed, which uses minimal prior information and detects contours independently of their shape, avoiding a segmentation bias. This approach has been shown to accurately segment a broad range of normal and disease-related morphological features, with high precision and recall rates.

## Development FAIR image analysis workflows and RDM pipelines in Galaxy

Riccardo Massei, Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Anne Fouilloux, Björg Gruening, Yi Sun, Diana Chiang, Matthias Bernt, Leonid Kostrykin

Published 2025-09-10

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Imaging is crucial across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences, where it plays a key role in studies ranging from single molecules to whole organisms. However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data present significant challenges. Managing and analyzing this data efficiently requires well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR principles—ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable across different domains. In the frame of NFDI4BIOIMAGE1 (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing, analyzing, and sharing bioimaging data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to make findable and machine-readable metadata developing analysis pipelines. In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity, supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata. Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis2. By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases the efficiency of RDM processes in bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific community's efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation. In the present poster, we showed how to integrate RDM processes and tools in Galaxy. We will showcase how Images can be enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to a target OME Remote Objects (OMERO) server using a novel set of OMERO tools developed with Galaxy3. Workflows give the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and perform image analysis (i.e. annotation). Furthermore, we will show the potential integration of eletronic lab books such as eLabFTW4, cloud storage systems (i.e. OneData)5 and interactive norebooks (Jupyter Notebooks) 6 in the Galaxy pipeline.

Microscopy data type: Light microscopy (Digital Phase Contrast and Brighfield )

Manual annotations: Labels/masks obtained via manual segmentation.&nbsp;For each region, all cells were annotated manually. Uncertain objects (Dust, fused cells) were left unannotated, so that the cellpose model (10.5281/zenodo.6023317) may mimic the same user bias during prediction. This was particularly necessary due to the accumulation of floating debris in the center of the well.

Microscope: Perkin Elmer Operetta microscope with a 10x 0.35 NA objective

Cell type: Primary Dermal Human Fibroblasts cells

File format: .tif (16-bit for DPC and 16-bit for the masks)

Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 cells were stained for DNA (to label nuclei) and actin (a cytoskeletal protein, to show the cell body). Automatic cytometry requires that cells be segmented, i.e., that the pixels belonging to each cell be identified. Because segmenting nuclei and distinguishing foreground from background is comparatively easy for these images, the focus here is on finding the boundaries between adjacent cells.

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Example Microscopy Metadata (Microscope.JSON and Settings.JSON) files produced using Micro-Meta App to document the Hardware Specifications of example Microscopes and the Image Acquisition Settings utilized to acquire example images as listed in the table below.


For each facility, the dataset contains two JSON files:


	Microscope.JSON file (e.g., 01_marcello_uliverpool_cci_zeiss_axioobserz1_lsm710.json)
	Settings.JSON file (indicated with the name of the image and with the _AS suffix)



Micro-Meta App was developed as part of a global community initiative including the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Imaging Working Group, BioImaging North America (BINA) Quality Control and Data Management Working Group, and QUAlity and REProducibility for Instrument and Images in Light Microscopy (QUAREP-LiMi), to extend the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) data model.


The works of this global community effort resulted in multiple publications featured on a recent Nature Methods FOCUS ISSUE dedicated to Reporting and reproducibility in microscopy.

## Excel template for adding Key-Value Pairs to images

Thomas Zobel, Jens Wendt

Published 2024-10-30

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This Excel Workbook contains some simple Macros to help with the generation of a .csv in the necessary format for Key-Value pair annotations of images in OMERO.
The format is tailored for the OMERO.web script&nbsp;"KeyVal_from_csv.py"&nbsp; (from the version &lt;=5.8.3 of the core omero-scripts).
Attached is also a video of Thomas Zobel, the head of the imaging core facility Uni M&uuml;nster, showcasing the use of the Excel workbook.The video uses a slightly older version of the workbook and OMERO, but the core functionality remains unchanged.
Please keep in mind, that the OMERO.web script(s) to handle Key-Value Pairs from/to .csv files will undergo a major change very soon.This might break the compatibility with the format used now for the generated .csv from the workbook.

Accurate segmentation of volumetric fluorescence image data has been a long-standing challenge and it can considerably degrade the accuracy of multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. To overcome this challenge, we developed a deep learning-based automatic 3D segmentation algorithm, called Starfinity. It first predicts its cell center probability and its radial distances to the nearest cell borders for each pixel. It then aggregates pixel affinity maps from the densely predicted distances and applies a watershed segmentation on the affinity maps using the thresholded center probability as seeds.

Data:
All the images were collected from 4 different research labs and a public database (SPARC database) to account for variations in image acquisition, sample preparation and immunolabelling.
For enteric neurons&nbsp;the pan-neuronal marker, Hu&nbsp;has been used and the&nbsp; 2D wholemounts images from mouse, rat and human tissue.
For enteric neuronal subtypes, 2D images for nNOS, MOR, DOR, ChAT, Calretinin, Calbindin, Neurofilament, CGRP and SST from mouse tissue have been used..
25 images were used&nbsp;from the following entries in the&nbsp;SPARC database:

For more information, visit the&nbsp;Documentation website.
NOTE: The images for enteric neurons and neuronal subtypes have been rescaled to 0.568 &micro;m/pixel for mouse and rat. For human neurons, it has been rescaled to 0.9 &micro;m/pixel . This is to ensure the neuronal cell bodies have similar pixel area across images. The area of cells in pixels can vary based on resolution of image, magnification of objective used, animal species (larger animals -&gt; larger neurons) and potentially how the tissue is stretched during wholemount preparation&nbsp;
Average neuron area for neuronal model:&nbsp;701.2 &plusmn; 195.9 pixel2 (Mean &plusmn; SD, 6267 cells)

Together with the molecular knowledge of genes and proteins, biological images promise to significantly enhance the scientific understanding of complex cellular systems and to advance predictive and personalized therapeutic products for human health. For this potential to be realized, quality-assured image data must be shared among labs at a global scale to be compared, pooled, and reanalyzed, thus unleashing untold potential beyond the original purpose for which the data was generated.

## Human HT29 colon-cancer cells

Licensed CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0



These images are of human HT29 colon cancer cells, a cell line that has been widely used for the study of many normal and neoplastic processes. A set of about 43,000 such images was used by Moffat et al. (Cell, 2006) to screen for mitotic regulators. The analysis followed the common pattern of identifying and counting cells with a phenotype of interest (in this case, cells that were in mitosis), then normalizing the count by dividing by the total number of cells. Such experiments present two image analysis problems. First, identifying the cells that have the phenotype of interest requires that the nuclei and cells be segmented. Second, normalizing requires an accurate cell count.

Published 2024-02-22



The zip file contains 3 folders (annotations, images and training_splits).The annotation folder contains 3 folders (cell_instances, nuclei_instances and semantic). Cell and nuclei instance annotations are long int tif images, containing numbered instance ids and 0 in the background. Semantic annotations are 8-bit int png files containing the class ids (0: background, 1: normal tissue, 2: erythrocytes, 3: alveolar epithelial type 2 cells, 4: alveolar macrophages, 5: other nuclei, 6: alveolar epithelial type 2 cell nuclei, 7: alveolar macrophage nuclei, 8: cell debris).
The image folder contains 4 folders (CD68, DAPI, DIC, proSPC), where DIC contains float valued background-corrected differential interference contrast images, the others contain normalized float-valued fluorescence channels of a multi-plex staining with CD-68 (whole alveolar macrophages), DAPI (any cell nuclei), proSPC (cytoplasm of alveolar epithelial type 2 cell). All images are in tif format.
The training split folder contains 3 text files, with the image prefix (compared to images and annotations without ending, i.e. e.g. without "_DIC.tif") of all cases in the respective subset. With a total of 68 cases, there are 51 cases in the train set, 7 cases in the validation set and 10 cases in the test set.The lung tissue origins from lung surgery of patients, but does not include resected tumors. Please see reference [1]. The images were acquired with a laser scanning microscope with 40x magnification and 1024 x 1024 pixels per image.

Since robust foreground/background separation and segmentation of cellular objects (i.e., identification of which pixels below to which objects) strongly depends on image quality, focus artifacts are detrimental to data quality. This image set provides examples of in- and out-of-focus HCS images which can be used for validation of focus metrics.

Hi&nbsp;@ome&nbsp;team !
We usually use ICS/IDS file formats as an output to our stitching pipeline as the reading and writing is pretty fast. However, it seems that since Bio-Formats 7.x opening the files is not working anymore.

## ImageJ Bioformats 8.3.0 Importer Incorrectly Reading ND2 Metadata

Snyder, Erika, Erika Thomas, Erika T.

Published 2025-08-21

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Hi all,I was referred to this community from the Image.sc Forum original post: https://forum.image.sc/t/imagej-bioformats-importer-incorrectly-reading-metadata/115943
I have an ND2 file, 3 color channels, 2 positions in the well, and 81 timepoints. However, when I open this as I normally would in ImageJ as a hyperstack, the stack interpretation is totally incorrect. It is including my Z-positions as frames in the timelapse. Even when I open the series for the positions independently, images from the other series will appear within it. I am running Bioformats 8.3.0.&nbsp;
I have tried swapping dimensions. That did not work. I have tried creating substacks to parse out one series from the other, this also did not work.
The only thing I can think of that is different from before is that I was previously aquiring z-stacks with our MCL nanodrive Piezo, and we had to have that serviced so in the meantime I used the Ti2 eclipse camera drive for z-stack aquisiton. I have opened the metadata to compare aquisitions between the two, and the stack order appears exactly the same, although Bioformats has no problem reading the metadata for aquisitions with the Piezo. I have also opened this file in NIS elements viewer, and all the information for the stacks appears correctly, so I dont think aquisitions is the issue.
I have also tried opening this file on multiple computers with multiple versions of imageJ, and the issue persists.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated I am panicking a bit because this is a few months worth of data I am suddenly not able to analyze.&nbsp;
Please let me know if there's anything else needed to help figure this out.&nbsp;

The software tool is developed on demand of Radiological Department of Faculty Hospital of Kr&aacute;lovsk&eacute; Vinohrady, with the aim to provide a tool to estimate the percentage of pneumonia (or COVID-19 presence) in lungs. Paper&nbsp;Estimation of Covid-19 lungs damage based on computer tomography images analysis presenting the tool is available on F1000reserach&nbsp;DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.109020.1. The underlying dataset is published in Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939).&nbsp;One of the challenges was to design a tool that would be available without complicated install procedures and would process data in a reasonable time even on office computers. For this reason, 8-bit and 16-bit version of the tool exists. The FIJI software (or ImageJ with Bio-Formats plugin installed) was selected as the best candidate. Examples of use and tutorials are available at GitHub.&nbsp;
The third version includes an intra-variabilty analysis, containing evaluation both for percentage and score metrics.

When using bioformats the images are not scaled correctly. The problem arises with low magnifications where the lengths in the metadata are given in &micro;m (not in nm). Attached are two pictures. Only with the picture with the ending &ldquo;Correct_scale_bar&rdquo; the import is working correctly. One issue might be that the metadata information of the images are stored in iso-8859-1&nbsp;

## Insights and Impact From Five Cycles of Essential Open Source Software for Science

Kate Hertweck, Carly Strasser, Dario Taraborelli

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Open source software (OSS) is essential for advancing scientific discovery, particularly in biomedical research, yet funding to support these vital tools has been limited. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program has significantly contributed to this field by providing $51.8 million in funding over five years to support the maintenance, growth, and community engagement of critical OSS tools. The program has impacted scientific OSS projects by improving their technical outputs, community building, and sustainability practices, and fostering collaborations within the OSS community. Additionally, EOSS funding has enhanced diversity, equity, and inclusion within the OSS community, although changes in principal investigator demographics were not observed. The funded projects have had a substantial impact on biomedical research by improving the usability and accessibility of scientific software, which has led to increased adoption and advancements in various biomedical fields.

## Institutionalization and Collaboration as a Way of Addressing the Challenges Open Science Presents to Libraries: The University of Konstanz as a National Pioneer

Sophie Habinger, Maximilian Heber, Sonja Kralj, Emilia Mikautsch

Published 2024-07-09

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



The rise of Open Science (OS) and the academic community&rsquo;s needs that come with it bring about a range of challenges for academic libraries. To face these challenges, the University of Konstanz has created a competence unit called&nbsp;Team Open Science&nbsp;in the Communication, Information, Media Center (KIM) - a joint unit of library and IT infrastructure. The Team creates synergies within itself and across the library. In December 2023, it involved 12 staff members specialising in open access (OA), research data management (RDM), open educational resources (OER) and virtual research environments (VRE). It collaborates closely with other KIM departments. This submission shall serve as a best practice example for the impact of OS on research libraries and, beyond that, the impact of research libraries on universities.
To enhance and foster OS, the Team provides individual consultations, services and office hours for researchers. Here, it collaborates closely with other librarians like subject specialists and the Team University Publications. Along similar lines, the KIM offers institutional repositories for publications (KOPS) and research data (KonDATA). Beyond that, the Team provides solutions to host OA journals and analyses researchers&rsquo; VRE needs to decide on implementation options. In sum, the Team is the central OS contact point for the entire university, underlining the major role the library holds in making institutional impact.
Furthermore, the Team had the leading role in creating the University of Konstanz&rsquo; OS Policy, one of the first ones passed by a German university. This policy stands out because it encompasses various OS domains. It demands, among other things, that text publications be made OA and that research data be managed according to relevant subject-specific standards. If permissible and reasonable, it demands that research data should be made publicly available at the earliest possible time. Along these lines, the policy has a large impact on how the library handles closed access books and subscription-based journals. As a consequence, OA is pursued wherever possible, leading to the highest OA quota of all German universities. In that sense, the Team is a crucial driving force of OS in the University of Konstanz, which ties in with the library&rsquo;s major role of open research transformation.
Beyond the University of Konstanz, the Team is involved in a range of national and international projects collaborating with other libraries. On a national level, they lead the project open.access-network which provides an information platform for researchers and librarians and connects the German-speaking OA community through events like bar camps. The project KOALA-AV supports libraries in establishing consortial solutions for financing Diamond OA publications. Moreover, the Team is involved in the federal state initiative for RDM in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg (bwFDM). Here, the Team is in charge of forschungsdaten.info, the German-speaking countries&rsquo; leading RDM information platform, which will be offered in English within the next years. Internationally, the Team cooperates with librarians and other OS professionals from the European Reform University Alliance (ERUA) and the European University for Well-Being (EUniWell), establishing formats for best practice exchange, such as monthly OS Meet-Ups.

## Integration of Bioimage and *Omics data resources

Carsten Fortmann-Grote, Mariana Meireles

Published 2025-02-03



This Poster was presented at the 2025 All Hands Meeting of the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Consortium. It presents the current state of data integration activities at the MPI for Evolutionary Biology. Various data and metadata resources such as the internal image data repository OMERO and the Electronic Lab Notebook System OpenBIS are converted into a RDF Knowledge Graph utilizing a R2RML mapping scheme based on the Ontop-VKG framework. The materialized Knowledge Graph is then served via the QLever SPARQL endpoint and user interface. A graphical query editor (SPARNatural) assists users with no SPARQL knowledge in constructing their queries by selecting triple elements from dropdown menus and other widgets.&nbsp;We also present a benchmark comparison of query response times on 10 selected SPARQL queries run against three different endpoint/triplestore implementations.&nbsp;

## Introducing OMERO-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data

Michele Bortolomeazzi, Christian Schmidt, Jan-Philipp Mallm

Published 2025-02-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



omero-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data viewing.
OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.
The three files in this Zenodo Record are all the same poster saved in different format all with high resolution images.

This is a short introduction to light-microscopy, illustrated with widefield microscopy.

It introduces :

- upright and inverted widefield microscopes

- the transmitted and fluorescent light-path

-&nbsp;contrasting methods (optical and at the sample level)

- the molecular principle of fluorescence (Perrin-Jablonski)

- objective, resolution and limitations of the method (diffraction, diffusion/scattering)

In addition to the PPT (with few animations), a lighter PDF version&nbsp;is provided for preview in Zenodo.

## Key-Value pair template for annotation in OMERO for light microscopy data acquired with AxioScan7 - Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI)

Silke Tulok, Anja Nobst, Anett Jannasch, Tom Boissonnet, Gunar Fabig

Published 2024-06-28

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This Key-Value pair template is used for the data documentation during imaging experiments and the later data annotation in OMERO. It is tailored for the usage and image acquisition at the slide scanning system Zeiss AxioScan 7 in the Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI). It contains important metadata of the imaging experiment, which are not saved in the corresponding imaging files. All users of the Core Facility Cellular Imaging are trained to use that file to document their imaging parameters directly during the data acquisition with the possibility for a later upload to OMERO. Furthermore, there is a corresponding public example image used in the publication "Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users" and is available here:
https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=image-33248
This template was developed by the CFCI staff during the setup and usage of the AxioScan 7 and is based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015).
With this template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate an image or dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).
How to use:

fill the template sheet&nbsp; with your metadata
select and copy the data range containing the Keys and Values
open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in cell A1&nbsp;
Important: cell A1 contains always the name 'dataset' and cell A2 contains the exact name of the image/dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv-file (comma separated values) format

An example can be seen in sheet 3 'csv_AxioScan'.
Important note: The code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might be not able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft-Office versions (MS Office 2016).&nbsp;
Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of comma as decimal delimiter.

Abstract:
European Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS-RIs), one of the five major RI Science Clusters in Europe, were established to provide access to cutting-edge technologies to the scientific community. Individually, and collectively as the LS-RI cluster, they contribute to the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), under the aegis of the EOSC Federation. They are actively involved in the design and implementation of Competence Centres (CCs). These aim to increase the accessibility of domain-specific knowledge and tools, enhance interoperability, facilitate sharing and harmonisation of procedures, and promote Open Science and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices. In this paper, we report a landscape mapping of the existing resources that formed the basis for the construction of CCs. We describe the possible design of CCs and their articulation with the LS-RIs. We focus on community-based ideas and recommendations to increase the potential of CCs to address long-standing challenges in sustainability, governance, scalability, and interoperability of Open Science within EOSC and the European Research Area (ERA) more generally.This paper provides a description of the nascent LS CCs, built following a survey of needs and services of existing LS-RI communities. When fully implemented, the LS CCs will serve as dynamic hubs to foster innovation, contribute to the EOSC&rsquo;s future FAIR web of data, and support ongoing developments of the EOSC Federation. They will act as drivers of collaborative and impactful LS research in Europe and beyond. We explore the underlying challenges, and propose solutions, to ensure that the establishment of CCs will add value to the LS RI community, and to the EOSC, in a sustainable way.

## Linking of Research (Meta-)data in OMERO to Foster FAIR Data in Plasma Science

Robert Wagner, Mohsen Ahmadi, Dagmar Waltemath, Kristina Yordanova, Becker, Markus M.

Published 2025-09-10

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Applied plasma research involves several disciplines such as physics, medicine and biology to solve application-oriented problems, often generating large and heterogeneous experimental data sets. The descriptions and metadata describing these interdisciplinary scientific investiga-tions is stored in distributed systems (e.g., physical laboratory notebooks or electronic labora-tory notebooks (ELN) like eLabFTW [1]), and the experimental data are either stored locally within the laboratories or on centralized institutional storage systems. As a result, the collected information often has to be tediously assembled for processing into publications. The workflow represented in Figure 1 addresses this suboptimal situation and promotes the combination of the image database OMERO [2], the ELN system eLabFTW, the research data management tool Adamant [3] and Python scripts for handling microscopy images in plasma life science and plasma medicine [4]. This workflow highlights how the developments from the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consortium can be brought into practical applications by addressing the specific demands of plasma science, where domain-specific metadata is essential for effective data interpretation and reuse. It showcases the benefits of FAIR [5] metadata combining do-main-specific requirements with method-specific solutions. Similar to most imaging workflows, image analysis in plasma research requires metadata from several sections of the experiment. Moreover, the plasma-related metadata are essential for the experimental context and must be included in the analysis, e.g. to describe the influence of plasma on the treated sample. Therefore, the metadata schema Plasma-MDS [6] is adapted to collect plasma-related metadata, such as information on the plasma species having a major impact on the treated samples. Alongside Plasma-MDS, the Recommended Metadata for Bio-logical Images (REMBI) standard [7] is used for the biological metadata such as the sample preparation and treatment procedures. The collection of these metadata is realized using Adamant, which enables the beginner-friendly collection of structured metadata. The tool presents JSON schemas in easy-to-read and easy-to-fill HTML forms, enabling metadata validation. Once completed and validated, the metadata are uploaded directly to eLabFTW using Adamant's workflow functionalities. The images from the treated samples are uploaded to OMERO by OMERO.insight and afterwards automatically annotated via Python scripts. These scripts take previously collected metadata from the related eLabFTW experiments and the microscope description metadata collected by the Micro Meta App [8], which are also stored in eLabFTW. The metadata is categorized and annotated according to the various data organizational levels within OMERO, specifically fo-cusing on project and dataset hierarchies, as well as screens that are composed of plates, which in turn contain wells. Screens resemble microwell plates, commonly used in a variety of biological experiments. The hieraic organization of metadata significantly enhances the ease of reusing images and associated metadata for subsequent processing and analysis. By efficiently distributing and reducing large metadata sets to an acceptable level, while simultaneously eliminating redun-dancies, this approach facilitates straightforward analyses with tools like ImageJ [9] and FIJI [10], thanks to the close association of metadata with the images themselves. In summary, one of the application-specific developments within the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consor-tium is presented, which contributes to the adoption of the FAIR principles in laboratory envi-ronments. Further work will address the integration of ontologies for the semantic description of data and metadata.

## LyNSeC: Lymphoma Nuclear Segmentation and Classification

Naji Hussein, Büttner Reinhard, Simon Adrian, Eich Marie-Lisa, Lohneis Philipp, Bozek Katarzyna

Published 2023-06-21

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Over the last years, there has been large progress in automated segmentation and classification methods in histological whole slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Current state-of-the-art techniques are based on diverse datasets of H&amp;E-stained WSIs of different types of predominantly solid cancer. However, there is a lack of publicly available annotated datasets of lymphoma, which is why we generated a labeled diffuse large B-cell lymphoma dataset and denoted it LyNSeC (lymphoma nuclear segmentation and classification). LyNSeC comprises three subsets: LyNSeC 1 consists of 379 IHC images of size 512 x 512 pixels at 40x magnification. In the images, we annotated the contours of each cell nuclei and the cell class: marker-positive or marker-negative.

In total, LyNSeC 1 contains 87,316 annotated cell nuclei of four different cases, with 48,171 of them assigned the class negative and 39,145 positive. We included three markers in this dataset showing visually different staining patterns: cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), Ki67 as a marker of proliferation, and erythroblast transformation-specific (EST)-related gene (ERG).

LyNSeC 2 and 3 contain H&amp;E-stained images of 70 different patients. LyNSeC 2 consists of 280 images and LyNSeC 3 of 40 images of size 512 x 512 pixels at 40x magnification. 65,479 and 8,452 nuclei were annotated in LyNSeC 2 and 3, respectively. In LyNSeC 3, the nuclei were also assigned a class label (tumor and non-tumor). 3,747 nuclei were identified as tumors and 4,705 as non-tumors.

In the annotation procedure, the contours of the H&amp;E images (LyNSeC 2 and LyNSeC 3) were annotated by two pathologists and by two students (trained by the pathologists). Annotation of the cell classes in LyNSeC 3 was done by the pathologists only. LyNSeC 1 was annotated by the two students who were additionally trained to annotate the contours and to distinguish marker-positive and marker-negative cells. The pathologists inspected and (if necessary) adjusted the LyNSeC 3 annotations.

The files are uploaded in &#39;.npy&#39; format. The files of LyNSeC 1 (x_l1.npy) and LyNSeC 3&nbsp;(x_l3.npy) contain five channels, respectively: the first three are the RGB channels of the images, channel 4 contains the instance maps, and channel 5 the class type maps (for LyNSeC 1 a pixel value of 1 corresponds to the class negative and 2 to the class positive, whereas in LyNSeC 3 1 corresponds to the class non-tumor and 2 to the class tumor). The files of LyNSeC 2 (x_l2.npy) have 4 channels (without the class type map).

Additionally, we also make our HoVer-Net-based pre-trained nuclei segmentation and classification models available (he.tar for H&amp;E images and ihc.tar for IHC images).

## Melanoma Histopathology Dataset with Tissue and Nuclei Annotations

Mark Schuiveling

Published 2025-03-19

Licensed CC-ZERO



Description:
This dataset is designed for development of deep learning models for segmentation of nuclei and tissue in melanoma H&amp;E stained histopathology. Existing nuclei segmentation models that are trained on non-melanoma specific datasets have low performance due to the ability of melanocytes to mimic other cell types, whereas existing melanoma specific models utilize older, sub-optimal techniques. Moreover, these models do not provide tissue annotations necessary for determining the localization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which may hold value for predictive and prognostic tasks. To address this, we created a melanoma specific dataset with nuclei and tissue annotations.&nbsp;
Methodology:
Sample Collection:
Regions of interest (ROIs) were sampled from H&amp;E stained slides of 103 primary melanoma specimens and 102 metastatic melanoma specimens, scanned using a Hamamatsu scanner at 40&times; magnification (0.23 &mu;m per pixel). All slides were obtained from regular diagnostic procedures.From each specimen, a 40&times; magnified ROI of 1024&times;1024 pixels was selected for annotation. Additionally, a context ROI of 5120&times;5120 pixels was sampled to provide information about the broader context for the annotation process. Selection was performed by a trained medical expert (M.S.) and subsequently verified by a dermatopathologist (W.B.). Manual ROI selection ensured the inclusion of diverse tissue and nuclei types.
Annotation Process:

Nuclei segmentationNuclei segmentations were generated using Hover-Net pretrained on the PanNuke dataset. Manual annotation adjustments were performed by author M.S. using QuPath, with the following nuclei categories: tumor, stroma, vascular endothelium, histiocyte, melanophage, lymphocyte, plasma cell, neutrophil, apoptotic cell, and epithelium. All annotations were reviewed and corrected, where needed, by a dermatopathologist (W.B.).
Tissue segmentationTissue segmentations were created manually using QuPath by M.S., with the following categories: tumor, stroma, epidermis, necrosis, blood vessel, and background. Annotations were reviewed and corrected, where needed, by a dermatopathologist (W.B.).

Quality Control: To assess the reliability of the annotations, intra- and interobserver agreement (by pathologist G.B.) were determined on 12 randomly selected ROIs.

Nuclei segmentationThe intraobserver overall precision was 84.89%, with a recall of 86.45%, and an F1 score of 85.66%. Interobserver overall precision was 80.34%, with a recall of 80.62%, and an F1 score of 80.20%. These results are based on the sum of all true positive, false positive, and false negative counts for the 12 ROIs.
Tissue segmentationThe DICE score was determined on the same 12 randomly selected ROIs. The average intraobserver DICE score was 0.90, and the interobserver DICE score was also 0.90.

&nbsp;
Version 3:Removed sample "training_set_metastatic_roi_103" due to inconsistencies in annotation file.
Version 4:Sample training_set_metastatic_roi_088 missed one color annotation for a nuclei_apoptosis in the geojson file rendering it qupath uncompatible. This is fixed in the new version.&nbsp;
Version 5:Addition of correct sample of training_set_metastatic_roi_103" after deadline of panoptic segmentation of nuclei and tissue in advanced melanoma challenge test phase.&nbsp;

Licensed CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0



The dataset for this challenge was obtained by carefully annotating tissue images of several patients with tumors of different organs and who were diagnosed at multiple hospitals. This dataset was created by downloading H&E stained tissue images captured at 40x magnification from TCGA archive. H&E staining is a routine protocol to enhance the contrast of a tissue section and is commonly used for tumor assessment (grading, staging, etc.). Given the diversity of nuclei appearances across multiple organs and patients, and the richness of staining protocols adopted at multiple hospitals, the training datatset will enable the development of robust and generalizable nuclei segmentation techniques that will work right out of the box.

The authors have developed a model for scientific metadata, and they have made that model usable by both CEDAR and FAIRware. The approach shows that a formal metadata model can standardize reporting guidelines and that it can enable separate software systems to assist (1) in the authoring of standards-adherent metadata and (2) in the evaluation of existing metadata.

Published 2012-06-28

Licensed CC0-1.0



Segmenting nuclei in 3D images can be challenging especially when nuclei are clustered not only in XY plane but also in XZ and YZ planes. Manually annotated ground truth provides a reference for image analysis software testing purposes. These images of mouse embryo blastocyst cells also have changing nuclei intensity in Z plane which makes finding the right threshold for successful segmentation a difficult task. This image set also contains GAPDH transcripts that can be quantified in each cell.

This image shows the BIIGLE image and video annotation tool, which is a web-based software for collaborative research on large imaging datasets [1, 2]. It offers tools for manual and computer-assisted annotation, quality control and the collaboration on custom taxonomies to describe objects. BIIGLE is freely available and can be installed in cloud environments, a local network or on mobile platforms during research expeditions. A public instance can be found at biigle.de.
The annotated image shows the coastline of Fernandina Island, Galapagos, which is the habitat of the Galapagos Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). The image is a large mosaic that was stitched together from many individual images captured by a drone. The green annotations marking the iguanas were machine-generated as part of a feasibility study for the automatic analysis of the data in the project Iguanas from Above [3, 4].

This image illustrates tissue oxygen saturation in the hand, calculated using various computer-assisted methods and based on hyperspectral and multispectral imaging. The purpose of this image is to compare the perfusion parameters (3 and 4) obtained with multispectral cameras delivering relatively less spectral information but capable of real-time imaging against the perfusion parameters (2) obtained with a hyperspectral medical system delivering large spectral information but not capable of real-time imaging. The picture shows that deep learning methods (4) perform better than classical methods (3) that are not based on artificial intelligence. It lays the groundwork for future real-time quantitative assessment of perfusion during organ transplantation surgeries.

Preparation method


10 &micro;m cryosections were acquired using the cryostar NX50 with a cutting temperature of -15 &deg;C. Tissues were section in 10 &micro;m slices and four samples were placed on one Xenium slide. Subsequently, the tissue was fixed with PFA according to the manufacture&acute;s protocol. Tissues were permeabilized with SDS, incubated in 70% ice cold methanol and washed with PBS. Hybridization of the human generic brain panel with 70 add-on genes (Supplementary Dataset 1) was performed at 50&deg;C in a Bio-Rad C1000 touch cycler for 20 hours. Washing, ligation and amplification steps were carried out according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. ROIs were selected according to the tissue area excluding non-tissue covered tiles. Each transcript was imaged in a bright state five times across 60 cycle-channels (15 cycles x 4 channels). After the run on the Xenium analyzer slides were removed and buffer exchanged with PBS-T for further storage at 4&deg;C.

Imaging of RNAscope samples and reimaging of Xenium slides by SDCM was conducted on an Andor Dragonfly 505 spinning disk confocal system equipped with a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope and a CFI P-Fluor 40X/1.30 oil objective or a Plan Apo 60x/1.40 oil objective. Multicolor images were acquired with the following laser lines 405 nm (DAPI), 488 nm (Alexa 488, eosin), 561 nm (Atto 550), 637 nm (Atto 647) 730nm (Alexa 750).




Image acquisition parameters


Images were recorded at 16-bit depth and with 1024x1024 pixels dimensions (pixel size: 0.217 &micro;m) using an iXon Ultra 888 EM-CCD camera. The region of interest was selected based on the DAPI signal and 50 z-slices were acquired with a step size of 0.4&thinsp;&micro;m (20&thinsp;&micro;m z-range) per field of view (FOV). Tiles were imaged with a 10% overlap to ensure accurate stitching.

Image processing method


Tiles were imaged with a 10% overlap to ensure accurate stitching. Subsequently, a flatfield-correction was conducted based on the DAPI channel and stitching and registration of the tiles was conducted with Fiji. First, SDCM image stacks were subjected to a maximum intensity projection, followed by flat field and chromatic aberration correction using a custom script. Next, image tiles were stitched using the &ldquo;Grid/Collection Stitching&rdquo; plugin. DAPI images from SDCM were registered to MC or Xenium widefield images using &ldquo;Register Virtual Stack Slices&rdquo; with Affine feature extraction model and the Elastic bUnwarpJ splines registration model. In case of further staining, images were transformed via Transform Virtual Stack slices employing the transformation file of the DAPI registration.

The sample was provided through a collaboration with the group of Thorsten Mascher at TU Dresden. Aim of this project is to explore the cellular autofluorescence patterns in Streptomyces using advanced imaging techniques.&nbsp;Streptomyces coelicolor are multicellular, mycelial bacteria that grow as vegetative hyphae. The use of confocal microscopy in this project was crucial for optically sectioning these filamentous cells, enabling the resolution of their cellular autofluorescence patterns with a high signal-to-noise ratio, which allowed us to visualize the 3D arrangement of the hyphae.

The culture was inoculated with a cellulose-overexpressing and surface-colonizing mScarlet-tagged wild type and a GFP-tagged mutant that is unable to colonize the surface. The biofilm can collapse over time due to its own mass, so that new strategies have to be developed and thus a life cycle emerges.

Image from the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Calendar May 2025.
The microscopy image captures the interaction between the barley cv. Golden Promise and the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria&nbsp;graminis&nbsp;f.sp.&nbsp;hordei, observed 48 hours post-inoculation. The fungus was stained with Coomassie dye, enhancing its visibility against the barley leaves. The leaves were prepared and fixed onto slides, followed by scanning with a Zeiss Axio Scan Z.1 microscope scanner using a 5x objective lens.
The upper section of the image displays the hyphal colonies, which were automatically segmented, highlighting the fungal structures (black) against the plant tissue (white). The lower section presents a machine learning-based analysis where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to predict the fungal structures. Here, the red bounding boxes show the outer boundaries of detected objects, while the green contours precisely trace the segmented hyphae, illustrating the effectiveness of the segmentation and prediction processes.

As part of the MibiNet SFB 1535 project (https://www.sfb1535.hhu.de), this lichen was collected in the Northern Eifel region, between Blankenheim and Schmidtheim in Germany. Lichens are among the most successful examples of complex mutualistic symbiosis, where a fungus (mycobiont) forms an association with one or more photosynthetic organisms (photobionts), including green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Based on ITS analysis, the lichen shown has been identified as Peltigera neckeri. Lichens of the genus Peltigera are classified as cyanolichens due to their symbiotic association with a cyanobacterial photobiont of the genus Nostoc. The image shows the lichen's blue-gray thallus when wet, after its collection on a mossy stone.

Raw microscopy image from the NFDI4Bioimage calendar March 2025.
The image shows 125x magnified microscopic details of a biofilm formed by Pseudomonas fluorescence on the surface of a liquid culture medium. The culture was inoculated with a cellulose-overexpressing and surface-colonizing mScarlet-tagged wild type and a GFP-tagged mutant that is unable to colonize the surface. The biofilm can collapse over time due to its own mass, so that new strategies have to be developed and thus a life cycle emerges.

This is an instance segmentation task where each cell has an individual label under the same category (cells). The training set contains both labeled images and unlabeled images. You can only use the labeled images to develop your model but we encourage participants to try to explore the unlabeled images through weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning.
&nbsp;
The images are provided with original formats, including tiff, tif, png, jpg, bmp... The original formats contain the most amount of information for competitors and you have free choice over different normalization methods. For the ground truth, we standardize them as tiff formats.
&nbsp;
We aim to maintain this challenge as a sustainable benchmark platform. If you find the top algorithms (https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/awards/) don't perform well on your images, welcome to send us the dataset (neurips.cellseg@gmail.com)! We will include them in the new testing set and credit your contributions on the challenge website!

Published 2012-06-28

Licensed CC0-1.0



This image set is part of a high-throughput chemical screen on U2OS cells, with examples of 200 bioactive compounds. The effect of the treatments was originally imaged using the Cell Painting assay (fluorescence microscopy). This data set only includes the DNA channel of a single field of view per compound. These images present a variety of nuclear phenotypes, representative of high-throughput chemical perturbations. The main use of this data set is the study of segmentation algorithms that can separate individual nucleus instances in an accurate way, regardless of their shape and cell density. The collection has around 23,000 single nuclei manually annotated to establish a ground truth collection for segmentation evaluation.

Cell dynamics during the early mouse embryogenesis change spatiotemporally. For understanding the mechanism of this developmental process, imaging cell dynamics by live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled nuclei and performing nuclei segmentation of these images by image processing are essential. This dataset contains the fluorescence images and Ground Truth used when performing nuclei segmentation using deep learning. Fluorescence images are time-series images from fertilization to blastocyst formation. Ground Truth is supervised data of the cell nuclear region.

Data and access to it are central to each NFDI consortium. However, moving data&nbsp;around is often impractical&mdash;it may be too large, sensitive, or restricted by agreements&nbsp;with, e.g., the funding provider, and copying introduces duplication, versioning issues,&nbsp;and loss of provenance. Rather than bringing data to the researcher, a Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) approach can offer researchers interactive, high-performance access in a secure and efficient manner. Driven by the need for seamless workflows and&nbsp;efficient data handling in NFDI4BIOIMAGE, we present a DaaS approach that is&nbsp;broadly applicable across NFDI. It supports diverse use cases, such as standardized&nbsp;virtual training environments for distributed participants (like required in DataPLANT), remote visualization of large-scale HPC datasets, and secure access to sensitive&nbsp;data (BERD)&mdash;all without the overhead of local machine setup and maintenance.

## Optimisation and Validation of a Swarm Intelligence based Segmentation Algorithm for low Contrast Positron Emission Tomography

Robert Haase

Published 2014-04-01

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In the field of radiooncological research, individualised therapy is one of the hot topics at the moment. As a key aspect biologically-adapted therapy is discussed. Therapy adaption based on biological parameters&nbsp;may include tomographic imaging to determine biological properties of the tumour. One often invoked&nbsp;imaging modality is positron emission tomography (PET) using the tracer [18F]-fluoromisonidazole&nbsp;(FMISO) for hypoxia imaging. Hypoxia imaging is of interest, because hypoxic tumours are known to be radiorestistant. Even further, patients with hypoxic tumours have worse prognosis compared to patients&nbsp;with normoxic tumours. Thus, hypoxia imaging appears promising for radiotherapy treatment adaption.&nbsp;For example, volumetric analysis of FMISO PET could deliver additional hypoxia target volumes, which&nbsp;may be irradiated with higher radiation doses to improve the therapeutic effect. However, limited contrast&nbsp;between target volume and background in FMISO PET images interferes image analysis.Established&nbsp;methods for target volume delineation in PET do not allow determination of reliable contours in FMISO PET. To tackle this aspect, this thesis focusses on an earlier developed swarm intelligence based&nbsp;segmentation algorithm for FMISO PET and rather, its optimisation and validation in a clinically relevant&nbsp;setting. In this setting, clinical FMISO PET images were used which were acquired as part of a clinical&nbsp;trial performed at the Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy and Radiooncology of the University&nbsp;Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. The segmentation algorithm was applied to these imaging data&nbsp;sets and optimised using a cross-validation approach incorporating reference contours from experienced&nbsp;observers who outlined FMISO PET positive volumes manually. Afterwards, the performance of the algorithm&nbsp;and the properties of the resulting contours were studied in more detail. The algorithm was shown&nbsp;to deliver contours which were similar to manually-created contours to a degree like manually-created&nbsp;contours were similar to each other. Thus, the application of the algorithm in clinical research is recommended&nbsp;to eliminate inter-observer-variabilities. Finally, it was shown that repeated FMISO PET imaging&nbsp;before and shortly after the beginning of combined radiochemotherapy lead to manually-created contours&nbsp;with significantly higher variations than the variations of automatically-created contours using the&nbsp;proposed algorithm. Increased contour similarity in subsequently acquired imaging data highlights the&nbsp;observer-independence of the algorithm. While several observers outline different volumes, in identical&nbsp;data sets as well as in subsequent imaging data sets, the algorithm outlines more stable volumes in both&nbsp;cases. Thus, increased contour reproducibility is reached by automation of the delineation process by&nbsp;the proposed algorithm.&nbsp;

## Platynereis dumerilii full-length transcriptome of developmental stages

Vellutini, Bruno C., Mette Handberg-Thorsager, Pavel Tomancak

Published 2024-11-29

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



To generate a high-quality full-length transcriptome for the annelid&nbsp;Platynereis dumerilii, we collected samples from representative developmental stages, from unfertilized eggs to 5 days post-fertilization. Each sample consisted of a bulk mix from 1 to 5 batches of embryos fertilized by different parents. We incubated all batches at 18 degrees Celsius until the desired time point, then collected the embryos into a clean tube and snap-froze them in liquid nitrogen with as little seawater as possible. The samples were stored at -80 degrees Celsius until RNA extraction. We extracted total RNA from the samples using a Trizol protocol. After measuring the RNA concentration with NanoDrop, we created a bulk RNA mix by combining 1 &micro;L from each sample into a new tube. We gave the sample to the Sequencing and Genotyping facility of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, who ran aliquots of this bulk mix through a Bioanalyzer and gel electrophoresis. They found no evidence of RNA degradation. From this sample, they prepared PacBio Iso-Seq libraries using the Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 and sequenced full-length transcripts on a SMRT 8M Cell for 30 hours using a PacBio Sequel II System. They processed the raw movie subreads with SMRT Analysis software, following the Iso-Seq v3 workflow to generate representative circular consensus sequences, demultiplex and remove primers, trim poly(A) tails, and remove concatemers. After transcript clustering and merging, the resulting dataset contained 176,122 polished high-quality isoforms. Using Cogent, we removed redundant isoforms and obtained a dataset with 117,524 transcripts. From this, we generated a dataset containing only the longest isoform for each gene, with 70,003 sequences in total. We calculated descriptive metrics using Transrate. To estimate their completeness, we used BUSCO for metazoa and obtained a score of 85%. Finally, we annotated the longest-isoform dataset using EnTAP. About 85% of the transcripts have a coding sequence. We obtained annotations for 67% of the sequences, while 33% have remained unannotated.

"Be SURE - Be SUstainable REcommendations"The main goals and challenges for the Life Science (LS) communities in the Open Science framework are to increase reuse and sustainability of data resources, software tools, and workflows, especially in large-scale data-driven research and computational analyses. Here, we present key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating and establishing sustainable LS resources based on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary work done within the EOSC-Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences) consortium. Bringing together 13 European LS Research Infrastructures (RIs), it has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational, technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC-Life provides a model for sustainable FAIR data management, including solutions for sensitive- and industry-related resources, by means of cross-disciplinary training and best practices sharing. Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.IN PRESS EMBO Journal:&nbsp;https://www.embopress.org/journal/14602075&nbsp;AVAILABLE SOON at : https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2023115008&nbsp;

## RDF as a bridge to domain-platforms like OMERO, or There and back again.

Josh Moore, Andra Waagmeester, Kristina Hettne, Katherine Wolstencroft, Susanne Kunis

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However, just a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the development of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes it possible to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot immediately be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering the benefit of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

These are synthetic images from the Cell Tracking Challenge. The images depict simulated nuclei of HL60 cells stained with Hoescht (training datasets). These synthetic images of HL60 cells provide an opportunity to test image analysis software by comparing segmentation results to the available ground truth for each time point. The number of clustered nuclei increases with time adding more complexity to the problem. This time-laps dataset can be used for simple segmentation or for nuclei tracking.

## Single-cell approach dissecting agr quorum sensing dynamics in Staphylococcus aureus

Julian Bär

Published 2024-02-28

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Training data for the two StarDist2D models and the DeLTA 2.0 2D tracking model used in the publication on&nbsp;bioarxiv. The trained stardist models are included in the respective zip files of the training data. mm: mother-machine; cc: connected chamber. Each of them contains two folders, img and seg_label. They contain matching pairs of phasecontrast images (img) and label images (seg_label).&nbsp;
&nbsp;
tracking_set_subset.zip contains the training data for the DeLTA tracking model following the default folder structure. We used custom weight functions to create the training weight maps in the folder wei. The folder wei_bck contains weights generated with the original function.
The unet_pads_tracking.hdf5 is the retrained tracking model used in the associated publication.
See associated GitHub repository for example code on how to use the models for segmentation and tracking.
The four numbered zip files contain the data used to create all figures displaying image analysis output.
Abstract:
Staphylococcus aureus both colonizes humans and causes severe virulent infections. Virulence is regulated by the agr quorum sensing system and its autoinducing peptide (AIP), with dynamics at the single-cell level across four agr-types &ndash; each defined by distinct AIP sequences and capable of cross-inhibition &ndash; remaining elusive. Employing microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and deep-learning image analysis, we uncovered significant differences in AIP sensitivity among agr-types. We observed bimodal agr activation, attributed to intergenerational phenotypic stability and influenced by AIP concentration. Upon AIP stimulation, agr‑III showed AIP insensitivity, while agr‑II exhibited increased sensitivity and prolonged generation time. Beyond expected cross-inhibition of agr‑I by heterologous AIP‑II and ‑III, the presumably cross-activating AIP‑IV also inhibited agr‑I. Community interactions across different agr-type pairings revealed four main patterns: stable or switched dominance, and delayed or stable dual activation, influenced by community characteristics. These insights underscore the potential of personalized treatment strategies considering virulence and genetic diversity.

Published 2024-05-02

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Dataset and StarDist model for the segmentation of Yersinia enterocolitica cells
This dataset and StarDist model are part of the publication "Active downregulation of the type III secretion system at higher local cell densities promotes Yersinia replication and dissemination".
It contains the dataset that was used for training the provided StarDist model using ZeroCostDL4Mic.
Data:
Yersinia enterocolitica cells were spotted on an agarose pad (1.5% low melting agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in minimal medium, 1% Casamino acids, 5 mM EGTA, &nbsp;glass depression slides (Marienfeld)). For imaging, a Deltavision Elite Optical Sectioning Microscope equipped with a UPlanSApo 100&times;/1.40 oil objective (Olympus) and an EDGE sCMOS_5.5 camera (Photometrics) was used. Z-stacks with 9 slices (∆z = 0.15 &micro;m) per fluorescence channel were acquired and &nbsp;5 slices were selected for network training. Images were annotated in Fiji using the Freehand selection tool, and brightlight and mask images were quartered to obtain the final dataset of 300 paired images. 260 images were used for training, while 40 images were used to test model performance.
Model:
The StarDist 2D model was trained from scratch for 100 epochs on 300 paired image patches (image dimensions: (480 x 480 px&sup2;), patch size: (480 x 480 px&sup2;)) with a batch size of 4 and a mae loss function, using the StarDist 2D ZeroCostDL4Mic notebook (v 1) (von Chamier &amp; Laine et al., 2020). Grid parameter was set to 2 and the number of rays to 120. The model was trained with an initial learning rate of 0.0003 using a 80/20 train/test split. The dataset was augmented 4-fold by flipping and rotation.
Key python packages used include tensorflow (v 0.1.12), Keras (v2.3.1), csbdeep (v 0.7.2), numpy (v 1.21.6), cuda (v 11.1.105Build cuda_11.1.TC455_06.29190527_0). The training was accelerated using a Tesla T4 GPU.

## Statistical Rethinking

Licensed CC0-1.0



This course teaches data analysis, but it focuses on scientific models. The unfortunate truth about data is that nothing much can be done with it, until we say what caused it. We will prioritize conceptual, causal models and precise questions about those models. We will use Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence. And we will learn powerful computational tools for coping with high-dimension, imperfect data of the kind that biologists and social scientists face.

## SynapseNet Training Data

Published 2024-12-01

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This dataset contains room-temperature single-axis TEM tomograms from Schaffer collateral and mossy fiber synapses in organotypic hippocampal slices.&nbsp;The tomograms were published in the two studies [1, 2]. The data was re-used for training deep neural networks to segment different synaptic structures in electron micrographs in [3].&nbsp;For the tomograms, organotypic slices were prepared from the hippocampi of neonatal mice according to the interface protocol55 and vitrified after 28 days in vitro in culture medium supplemented with 20% (w/v) bovine serum albumin using an HPM100 (Leica) high-pressure freezing device. The dataset also contains 23 tomograms resulting from chemically-fixed material, which were also published in (Maus et al., 2020). For these tomograms, wild-type animals at postnatal day 28 were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia, first with 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and then one of two fixatives (Fixative 1: Ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer16; Fixative 2: 37&deg; C 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2 mM CaCl2, in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer56). Brains were rinsed and sectioned coronally through the dorsal hippocampus in an ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer using a VT 1200S vibratome (Leica) (step size 100 &micro;m; amplitude 1.5 mm, speed 0.1 mm/sec). Hippocampal CA3 subregions were excised using a 1.5 mm diameter biopsy punch and high-pressure frozen on the same day in 20% (w/v) bovine serum albumin using an HPM100 (Leica) high-pressure freezing device. For both sample preparations, automated freeze-substitution was performed. Tomograms were collected using a 200 kV JEM-2100 (JEOL) transmission electron microscope equipped with an 11 MP Orius SC1000 CCD camera (Gatan). Tilt-series (tilt range +/- 60&deg;; 1&deg; angular increments) were acquired at 30 000x magnification using SerialEM58. Tomographic reconstructions were generated using weighted back-projection with etomo.The data is organized into two different subfolders for data with annotations for "vesicles" and "active_zones". Each of these subfolders is further subdivided into "train" and "test" folders, which containtomograms for the two different sample preparations in "chemical_fixation" and "single_axis_tem".Each tomogram and the corresponding annotation is stored as a hdf5 file, containing the following internal datasets:- raw: The tomogram data.- labels/vesicles: Annotations for the synaptic vesicles, annotated with IMOD, further postprocessed and then exported to instance masks. (for tomograms in "vesicles")- labels/AZ: Annotations for the active zone, annotated with IMOD and exported to binary masks.

## Terminology service for research data management and knowledge discovery in low-temperature plasma physics

Markus M. Becker, Ihda Chaerony Siffa, Roman Baum

Published 2024-12-11

Abstract: 
Terminology services (TS) [1,2] play a pivotal role in achieving structured metadata by providing controlled vocabularies and ontologies that standardize the description of data. This is a crucial aspect of research data management (RDM) in all scientific disciplines. In addition, TS facilitate the use of a common vocabulary within a scientific community also in a more general context, e.g. to annotate scientific papers, patents or other content for better discoverability, as envisaged by the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) [3] or the Patents4Science project [4].&nbsp;
To make use of these opportunities, terminologies, ontologies and knowledge graphs must be developed and made available as TS where they do not yet exist. This step is currently being taken by the research community in low-temperature plasma (LTP) physics. LTP physics explores partially ionized gases and its technological applications. This vibrant field offers innovative solutions for societal challenges, ranging from developing efficient lighting and solar cells to revolutionizing healthcare through plasma medicine. Various activities and projects have been started in the past years to support the RDM in LTP research and development and to facilitate the application of data-driven research methods. These activities are supported in parts by the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consortium, active work in the NFDI section &ldquo;(Meta)data, Terminologies, Provenance&rdquo;, and the basic service Terminology Services 4 NFDI (TS4NFDI) funded by Base4NFDI.&nbsp;
Recently, the ontology Plasma-O [5&ndash;7] for LTP physics has been developed at INP in collaboration with FIZ Karlsruhe &ndash; Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure, providing a framework for structuring metadata and building a knowledge graph for scientific information within the field. The present contribution will show how a TS utilizing this resource can support different aspects of RDM and knowledge discovery using concrete examples. The application cases include (i) standardizing data annotation: By providing researchers with a controlled vocabulary of LTP-specific terms and their relationships, ensuring consistent and unambiguous data descriptions; (ii) enabling semantic search: Moving beyond keyword-based searches, TS allow for complex queries based on the relationships between concepts, significantly improving data discoverability; (iii) facilitating data integration: By mapping data from different sources to a common ontology, TS enable seamless integration and analysis of heterogeneous datasets, which is crucial for data-driven research and development. The TS Suite of TS4NFDI with the provided widgets [8] fits perfectly to the requirements of these three application cases and will support the harmonization of metadata in LTP physics. The implementation of a public TS is required to provide the domain-specific metadata in a standardized format and will be instrumental in unlocking the full potential of the TS widgets for RDM and knowledge discovery by LTP researchers. Furthermore, the results can provide insights to other domains on how to apply TS to their specific needs.
&nbsp;The work was supported in parts by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under the National Research Data Infrastructure &ndash; [NFDI46/1] &ndash; 501864659 and project number 496963457 as well as by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), project number 16KOA013A.

Mouse duodenum fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4&deg;C, processed for paraffin infiltration using a standard histology procedure and cut at 4 microns were dewaxed, rehydrated, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS 1x and stained with Azide - Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher) to detect EdU and DAPI for nuclei. The images were taken using a Leica DM5500 microscope with a 40X N.A.1 objective (black&amp;white camera: DFC350FXR2, pixel dimension: 0.161 microns). Next, the slide was unmounted and stained using the fully automated Ventana Discovery xT autostainer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). All steps were performed on automate with Ventana solutions. Sections were pretreated with heat using the CC1 solution under mild conditions. The primary rat anti BrDU (clone: BU1/75 (ICR1), Serotec, diluted 1:300) was incubated 1 hour at 37&deg;C. After incubation with a donkey anti rat biotin diluted 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), chromogenic revelation was performed with DabMap kit. The section was counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (J.T. Baker) before a second round of imaging on DM5500 PL Fluotar 40X N.A.1.0 oil (color camera: DFC 320 R2, pixel dimension: 0.1725 microns). Before acquisition, a white-balance as well as a shading correction is performed according to Leica LAS software wizard. The fluorescence and DAB images were converted in ome.tiff multiresolution file with the kheops Fiji Plugin.

Sampled prepared in the EPFL histology core facility by Nathalie M&uuml;ller and Gian-Filippo Mancini.

Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing, researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.

Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) aims to establish a sustained, cross-disciplinary research data management (RDM) infrastructure that enables researchers to handle FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data. While&nbsp;FAIR principles have been&nbsp;adopted by funders, policymakers, and publishers, their practical implementation remains an ongoing effort. In the field of bio-imaging, harmonization of&nbsp;data formats, metadata ontologies, and open data repositories is necessary&nbsp;to achieve FAIR data.&nbsp;The NFDI4BIOIMAGE was established&nbsp;to address these issues and&nbsp;develop tools and best practices to facilitate FAIR microscopy and image analysis data in alignment with international community activities. The&nbsp;consortium operates through its Data Stewards team to provide expertise and direct support to help overcome RDM challenges. The three Helmholtz Centers in NFDI4BIOIMAGE aim to collaborate closely with other centers and initiatives, such as HMC, Helmholtz AI, and HIP. Here we present NFDI4BIOIMAGE&rsquo;s work and its significance for research in Helmholtz and beyond

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific research presents both opportunities and challenges for life scientists. Key challenges include ensuring transparency in AI-generated content and facilitating efficient knowledge exchange among researchers. These issues arise from the in-transparent nature of AI-driven code generation and the informal sharing of AI insights, which may hinder reproducibility and collaboration. This paper introduces git-bob, an innovative AI-assistant designed to address these challenges by fostering an interactive and transparent collaboration platform within GitHub. By enabling seamless dialogue between humans and AI, git-bob ensures that AI contributions are transparent and reproducible. Moreover, it supports collaborative knowledge exchange, enhancing the interdisciplinary dialogue necessary for cutting-edge life sciences research. The open-source nature of git-bob further promotes accessibility and customization, positioning it as a vital tool in employing LLMs responsibly and effectively within scientific communities.

## Working Group Charter. RDM Helpdesk Network

Support is an essential component of an efficient infrastructure for research data management (RDM). Helpdesks guide researchers through this complex landscape and provide reliable support about all questions regarding research data management, including support for technical services, best practices, requirements of funding organizations and legal topics. In NFDI, most consortia have already established or are planning to establish helpdesks to support their specific communities. On a local level, many institutions have set up RDM helpdesks that provide support for the researchers of their own institution. Additional RDM support services are offered by RDM federal state initiatives, by research data centers, by specialist libraries, by the EOSC, and by providers of RDM-relevant tools. Helpdesks cover a wide range of institutions, disciplines, topics, methodologies and target audiences. However, the individual helpdesks are not yet interconnected and therefore cannot complement one another in an efficient way: Given the wide and constantly increasing complexity of RDM, no single helpdesk can provide the expertise for all potential support requests. Therefore, we see great potential in combining the efforts and resources of the existing RDM helpdesks into an efficient and comprehensive national RDM support network in order to provide optimal and tailored RDM support to all researchers and research-related institutions in Germany and in an international context.

## Zarr - A Cloud-Optimized Storage for Interactive Access of Large Arrays

Josh Moore, Susanne Kunis

Published 2023-09-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



For decades, the sharing of large N-dimensional datasets has posed issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or down-sampled representations on the fly. Now, a cloud-native chunked format easing this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The format — Zarr — is potentially of interest for other consortia and sections of NFDI.

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions
Establish a stakeholder process management for installing OMERO-based RDM
Learn from each other, leverage different expertise
Learn how to train users, establish sustainability strategies, and foster FAIR RDM for bioimaging at your institution
