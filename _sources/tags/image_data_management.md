## REMBI - Recommended Metadata for Biological Images—enabling reuse of microscopy data in biology

Ugis Sarkans, Wah Chiu, Lucy Collinson, Michele C. Darrow, Jan Ellenberg, David Grunwald, et al.

Published 2021-05-21

Licensed UNKNOWN



Bioimaging data have significant potential for reuse, but unlocking this potential requires systematic archiving of data and metadata in public databases. The authors propose draft metadata guidelines to begin addressing the needs of diverse communities within light and electron microscopy.

## Towards community-driven metadata standards for light microscopy - tiered specifications extending the OME model

Mathias Hammer, Maximiliaan Huisman, Alessandro Rigano, Ulrike Boehm, James J. Chambers, et al.

Published 2022-07-10

Licensed UNKNOWN



Rigorous record-keeping and quality control are required to ensure the quality, reproducibility and value of imaging data. The 4DN Initiative and BINA here propose light Microscopy Metadata specifications that extend the OME data model, scale with experimental intent and complexity, and make it possible for scientists to create comprehensive records of imaging experiments.
