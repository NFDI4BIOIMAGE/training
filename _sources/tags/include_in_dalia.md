## A Perspective on FAIR and Scalable Access to Large Image Data

Julia Thönnißen, Sarah Oliveira, Alexander Oberstrass, Jan-Oliver Kropp, Xiao Gui, Christian Schiffer, Timo Dickscheid

Published 2025-08-04

The rapid development of new imaging technologies across scientific domains–especially high-throughput technologies–results in a growing volume of image datasets in the Tera- to Petabyte scale. Efficient visualization and analysis of such massive image resources is critical but remains challenging due to the sheer size of the data, its continuous growth, and the limitations of conventional software tools to address these problems. Tools for visualization, annotation and analysis of large image data are confronted with the fundamental dilemma of balancing computational efficiency and memory requirements. Many tools are unable to process large datasets due to memory constraints, requiring workarounds like downsampling. On the other hand, solutions that can handle large data efficiently often rely on specialized or even proprietary file formats, limiting interoperability with other software. This reflects diverging requirements: storage favours compression for efficiency, analysis demands fast data access, and visualization requires tiled, multi-resolution representations. Lacking a unified approach for these conflicting needs, the operation of large and dynamically evolving image repositories in practice often requires undesirable data conversions and costly data duplication. In addressing these challenges, the bioimaging community increasingly adheres to the FAIR principles [1] through national and international initiatives [2], [3], [4]. For example, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) fosters standards such as OME-TIFF [5] and its cloud-native successor OME-NGFF [6]; BioFormats [7] and OMERO [8] facilitate metadata-rich data handling across diverse platforms; and BrAinPI [9] provides web-based visualization of images via Neuroglancer [10]. These tools represent important developments towards more efficient and standardized use of bioimaging data. However, for very large and dynamically growing repositories, it is still not feasible to settle on a single standard for a subset of these tools, in particular in the light of very diverging needs for massively parallel processing on HPC systems. Therefore, converting data to a single target format is often not a practical solution. We propose a concept for a modular image delivery service which acts as a middleware between large image data resources and applications, serving image data from a cloud resource in multiple requested representations on demand. The service allows reading data stored in different input file formats, applying coordinate transformations and filtering operations on-the-fly, and serving the results in a range of different output formats and layouts. Building upon a common framework for reading and transforming data, an extensible set of access points connects the service to client applications: Lightweight REST APIs allow web-based mutli-resolution access (e.g., in common formats such as used in Neuroglancer and OpenSeadragon base viewers); mountable filesystem interfaces enable linking the repository to file-oriented solutions (e.g., OMERO, ImageJ); and programmatic access from customizable software tools (e.g., Napari). To provide compatibility with upcoming image data standards like BIDS [11] and minimize conversion efforts, the service is able to dynamically expose standard-conform views into arbitrarily organized datasets. The proposed approach for reading and transforming data on-the-fly eliminates the need for redundant storage and application-specific conversions of datasets, improving workflow efficiency and sustainability. In summary, we advocate for the development of a flexible and extensible image data service that supports large-scale analysis, dynamic transformations, multi-tool interoperability, and compatibility with community standards for large image datasets. This way it supports the FAIR principles, reduces integration barriers, meets the performance demands of modern imaging research, and still fosters the use of existing community developments.

## A journey to FAIR microscopy data

Oral presentation, 32nd MoMAN &quot;From Molecules to Man&quot; Seminar, Ulm, online. Monday February 6th, 2023

Abstract:

Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects. To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats, data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.

In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification. German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities, research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice. &nbsp;

## Accessible Interactive Spatial-Omics Data Visualizations with Vitessce and OMERO

Bortolomeazzi Michele

Published 2025-06-30

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.

Summary:
The BioImage Analysis and Superresolution Microscopy Workshop 2023 took place at Dartmouth College, offering participants a comprehensive learning experience in the field of bioimage analysis and superresolution microscopy. Over the course of two days, researchers, scientists, and students immersed themselves in cutting-edge microscopy techniques and expanded their knowledge and practical skills.

Day 1 (Tue, June 6):
The workshop began with Zdenek Svindrych providing an overview of microscopy principles, methods, and theoretical foundations. Participants gained insights into image formation in fluorescence microscopes, resolution, and noise. This was followed by an introduction to superresolution microscopy techniques, including Single-Molecule localization Microscopy (STORM, PALM, DNA-PAINT) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM, ISM, Airyscan, SoRa). Zuzana Burdikova then guided attendees through the theoretical aspects of bioimage processing in Fiji, covering image formats, multi-dimensional image analysis, data visualization, and quantitative analysis. Practical sessions allowed participants to apply their knowledge, exploring two-channel colocalization, image filtering, and quantitative measurements in Fiji.

Day 2 (Wed, June 7):
The second day commenced with a remote presentation by SVI.nl, introducing participants to the Huygens deconvolution software used in widefield, confocal, and superresolution microscopy. Zdenek Svindrych demonstrated the practical applications of ThunderSTORM, an ImageJ plug-in for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data analysis and superresolution imaging. The session included an overview of the ThunderSTORM workflow, covering localization, filtering, rendering, and 3D STORM using the astigmatism method. Jakub Soukup explored advanced noise reduction algorithms such as Noise2Void and StarDist. Martin Sch&auml;tz discussed data management strategies.

In the afternoon, participants engaged in practical sessions. Martin Sch&auml;tz presented Ilastik, a versatile software for image classification and segmentation. Pat Robison delivered a scientific lecture on the role of detyrosinated microtubules in contracting cardiomyocytes. Zdenek Svindrych, along with other experts, led a hands-on session on customizing Fiji using the ImageJ Macro language. The day concluded with a practical session on the interactive design of GPU-accelerated image data flow graphs in Fiji, guided by Martin Sch&auml;tz and the workshop team.

Imaging plays a crucial role across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences. However, image data often proves complex, and the volume of images requiring analysis is steadily increasing, especially in high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms. Specifically, analysis pipelines must align to the FAIR principles, ensuring they are reusable and interchangeable across different domains

Bioimaging has now entered the era of big data with faster than ever development of complex microscopy technologies leading to increasingly complex datasets. This enormous increase in data size and informational complexity within those datasets has brought with it several difficulties in terms of common and harmonized data handling, analysis and management practices, which are currently hampering the full potential of image data being realized. Here we outline a wide range of efforts and solutions currently being developed by the microscopy community to address these challenges on the path towards FAIR bioimage data. We also highlight how different actors in the microscopy ecosystem are working together, creating synergies that develop new approaches, and how research infrastructures, such as Euro-BioImaging, are fostering these interactions to shape the field.&nbsp;

Interdisciplinary collaboration and integration of large and diverse datasets are becoming increasingly important. Answering complex research questions requires combining and analysing multimodal datasets. Research data management follows the FAIR principles making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. However, there are challenges in capturing the entire research cycle and contextualizing data according, not only for the DataPLANT and NFDI4BIOIMAGE communities. To address these challenges, DataPLANT developed a data structure called Annotated Research Context (ARC). The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) originated from the neuroimaging community extended for microscopic image data. Both concepts provide standardised and file system based data storage structures for organising and sharing research data accompanied with metadata. We exemplarily compare the ARC and BIDS designs and propose structural and metadata mapping.

## Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses

Beth Cimini et al.

Licensed BSD-3-CLAUSE



This book is a companion to the Nature Methods publication Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses. In this paper, members of QUAREP-LiMi have proposed 3 sets of standards for publishing image figures and image analysis - minimal requirements, recommended additions, and ideal comprehensive goals. By following this guidance, we hope to remove some of the stress non-experts may face in determining what they need to do, and we also believe that researchers will find their science more interpretable and more reproducible.

## DALIA Interchange Format

Jonathan Geiger, Petra Steiner, Abdelmoneim Amer Desouki, Frank Lange

Published 2024-06-07

Licensed CC-BY-SA-4.0



The DALIA (Data Literacy Alliance) project aims to develop a knowledge graph for FAIR teaching and learning materials on data literacy, data competencies and research data management (RDM) skills within the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and the RDM landscape. Such a platform thrives on the participation of users who want to search, create, manage or use teaching and learning materials.
A schematization of the metadata is necessary for the interoperability of teaching and learning materials. This is done by the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF), which provides a framework for making the metadata of teaching and learning materials transparent, comparable and smooth to integrate into the DALIA platform. It includes the description and explanation of the data fields for the online publication of educational resources.
The DIF was developed in close consultation with the scientific community. This development process included several feedback rounds in which valuable feedback was provided and subsequently incorporated into the DIF. This not only contributed to the clear, transparent and user-oriented definitions of the data fields, and to a clear structure, but also to the integration of many existing data standards and to the (special) requirements of the scientific community. The selection of elements is based on the&nbsp;Dublin Core Application Profile.
The DIF is provided as a PDF document and in table form (ODS) to convey the attributes of the teaching and learning materials and their definitions in an easily understandable form and to facilitate communication. It also includes a legend and an example in tabular form. In addition, a template (CSV) with the attributes as column headers is provided, which can be used for recording the metadata of the teaching and learning materials. The tables can also be transferred to technical application profiles.
We would like to thank all the commentators of the previous versions, especially Susanne Arndt, Sophie Bo&szlig;e, Sonja Felder, Marc Fuhrmans, Jan-Michael Haugwitz, Marina Lemaire, Karoline Lemke, Birte Lindst&auml;dt, Juliane R&ouml;der, and Jakob Vo&szlig;. Without their feedback and advice, the DIF would be less transparent.

A more detailed understanding of the effect of plasmas on biological systems can be fostered by combining data from different imaging modalities, such as optical imaging, fluorescence imaging, and mass spectrometry imaging. This, however, requires the implementation and use of sophisticated research data management (RDM) solutions to incorporate the influence of plasma parameters and treatment procedures as well as the effects of plasma on the treated targets. In order to address this, RDM activities on different levels and from different perspectives are started and brought together within the framework of the NFDI consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE.

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Was ist ein Datenmanagementplan? Welche Vorgaben sollte ich beachten? Wie erstelle ich einen solchen f&uuml;r mein Forschungsprojekt und welche n&uuml;tzlichen Tools kann ich hierf&uuml;r verwenden?

Die Anforderungen der Forschungsf&ouml;rderer zum Datenmanagement steigen stetig. Damit verbunden ist h&auml;ufig auch das Erstellen eines Datenmanagementplans. Dabei erwarten DFG, BMBF oder die EU jeweils unterschiedliche Angaben zur Erhebung, Speicherung und Ver&ouml;ffentlichung von projektbezogenen Forschungsdaten. Zudem bietet das Erstellen eines Datenmanagementplans viele Vorteile und hilft Ihnen nicht zuletzt, die Anforderungen der guten wissenschaftlichen Praxis strukturiert umzusetzen.

Was im ersten Moment un&uuml;bersichtlich und &uuml;berfordernd wirkt, soll in diesem Kurs anhand einer grundlegenden theoretischen Einf&uuml;hrung im ersten und praxisorientierter Beispiele im zweiten Teil der Veranstaltung handhabbar gemacht werden. Sie lernen, was hinter den Anforderungen der Forschungsf&ouml;rderer steckt, welche Elemente ein Datenmanagementplan enthalten sollte und wie sie einen solchen mithilfe interaktiver Tools selbst erstellen k&ouml;nnen.

## Development of a platform for advanced optics education, training and prototyping

Nadine Utz, Sabine Reither, Ruth Hans, Christian Feldhaus

Published 2023-10-05

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In bio-medical research we often need to combine a broad range of expertise to run complex experiments and analyse and interpret their results. Also, it is desirable that all stakeholders of a project understand all parts of the experiment and analysis to draw and support the right conclusions. For imaging experiments this usually requires a basic understanding of the underlying physics. This has not necessarily been part of the professional training of all stakeholders, e.g. biologists or data scientists. Therefore an affordable platform for easily demonstrating and explaining imaging principles would be desirable.
Building up on a commercially available STEM Optics kit we developed extensions with widely available and affordable components to demonstrate advanced imaging techniques like e.g. confocal, lightsheet, OPT, spectral imaging. All models are quick and easy to build, yet demonstrate the important physical principles each imaging technique is based on.
Further use cases for this kit are training courses, demonstrations for imaging newbies when designing an experiment and outreach activities but also basic level prototyping.

## Dr Guillaume Jacquemet on studying cancer cell metastasis in the era of deep learning for microscopy

Guillaume Jacquemet

Published 2024-10-24

Licensed UNKNOWN



Leukocyte extravasation is a critical component of the innate immune response, while circulating tumour cell extravasation is a crucial step in metastasis formation. Despite their importance, these extravasation mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this talk, Guillaume Jacquemet presents a novel imaging framework that integrates microfluidics with high-speed, label-free imaging to study the arrest of pancreatic cancer cells (PDAC) on human endothelial layers under physiological flow conditions.

## Efficiently starting institutional research data management

Katarzyna Biernacka, Katrin Cortez, Kerstin Helbig

Published 2019-10-15

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Researchers are increasingly often confronted with research data management (RDM) topics during their work. Higher education institutions therefore begin to offer services for RDM at some point to give support and advice. However, many groundbreaking decisions have to be made at the very beginning of RDM services. Priorities must be set and policies formulated. Likewise, the staff must first be qualified in order to provide advice and adequately deal with the manifold problems awaiting.
The FDMentor project has therefore bundled the expertise of five German universities with different experiences and levels of RDM knowledge to jointly develop strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and open access training material. Humboldt-Universit&auml;t zu Berlin, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin, University of Potsdam, and European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) have worked together on common solutions that are easy to adapt. With funding of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the collaborative project addressed four problem areas: strategy development, legal issues, policy development, and competence enhancement. The aim of the project outcomes is to provide other higher education institutions with the best possible support for the efficient introduction of research data management. Therefore, all project results are freely accessible under the CC-BY 4.0 international license. The early involvement of the community in the form of workshops and the collection of feedback has proven its worth: the FDMentor strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and training materials are applied and adapted beyond the partner universities.

## Engineering a Software Environment for Research Data Management of Microscopy Image Data in a Core Facility

Kunis

Published 2022-05-30



This thesis deals with concepts and solutions in the field of data management in everyday scientific life for image data from microscopy. The focus of the formulated requirements has so far been on published data, which represent only a small subset of the data generated in the scientific process. More and more, everyday research data are moving into the focus of the principles for the management of research data that were formulated early on (FAIR-principles). The adequate management of this mostly multimodal data is a real challenge in terms of its heterogeneity and scope. There is a lack of standardised and established workflows and also the software solutions available so far do not adequately reflect the special requirements of this area. However, the success of any data management process depends heavily on the degree of integration into the daily work routine. Data management must, as far as possible, fit seamlessly into this process. Microscopy data in the scientific process is embedded in pre-processing, which consists of preparatory laboratory work and the analytical evaluation of the microscopy data. In terms of volume, the image data often form the largest part of data generated within this entire research process. In this paper, we focus on concepts and techniques related to the handling and description of this image data and address the necessary basics. The aim is to improve the embedding of the existing data management solution for image data (OMERO) into the everyday scientific work. For this purpose, two independent software extensions for OMERO were implemented within the framework of this thesis: OpenLink and MDEmic. OpenLink simplifies the access to the data stored in the integrated repository in order to feed them into established workflows for further evaluations and enables not only the internal but also the external exchange of data without weakening the advantages of the data repository. The focus of the second implemented software solution, MDEmic, is on the capturing of relevant metadata for microscopy. Through the extended metadata collection, a corresponding linking of the multimodal data by means of a unique description and the corresponding semantic background is aimed at. The configurability of MDEmic is designed to address the currently very dynamic development of underlying concepts and formats. The main goal of MDEmic is to minimise the workload and to automate processes. This provides the scientist with a tool to handle this complex and extensive task of metadata acquisition for microscopic data in a simple way. With the help of the software, semantic and syntactic standardisation can take place without the scientist having to deal with the technical concepts. The generated metadata descriptions are automatically integrated into the image repository and, at the same time, can be transferred by the scientists into formats that are needed when publishing the data.

Sie stellen keine offizielle Positionierung des Ombudsman f&uuml;r die Wissenschaft (OfdW) dar, sondern beschreiben den Status Quo und ordnen bereits bestehende Empfehlungen aus Sicht der GWP ein, identifizieren L&uuml;cken und verweisen auf weiterf&uuml;hrende Literatur. Diese FAQ-Sammlung richtet sich prim&auml;r an Forschende. F&uuml;r die Nutzung von KI in der Lehre und in studentischen (Qualifikations-)Arbeiten sind i.d.R. universit&auml;re KI-Richtlinien, angepasste Pr&uuml;fungsordnungen und Selbstst&auml;ndigkeitserkl&auml;rungen sowie Entscheidungen individueller Lehrpersonen ma&szlig;geblich. Daher werden eventuelle Besonderheiten von KI in der Lehre und in Pr&uuml;fungsangelegenheiten in diesen FAQ nicht besprochen.

## From Cells to Pixels: Bridging Biologists and  Image Analysts Through a Common Language

Elnaz Fazeli, Haase Robert, Doube Michael, Miura Kota, Legland David

Published 2024-08-16

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Bioimaging has transformed our understanding of biological processes, yet extracting&nbsp;meaningful information from complex datasets remains a challenge, particularly for&nbsp;early career scientists. This paper proposes a simplified, systematic approach to&nbsp;bioimage analysis, focusing on categorizing commonly observed structures and&nbsp;shapes, and providing relevant analysis methods. Our approach includes illustrative&nbsp;examples and a visual flowchart, enabling researchers to define analysis objectives&nbsp;clearly. By understanding the diversity of bioimage structures and aligning them with&nbsp;appropriate analysis approaches, the framework empowers researchers to navigate&nbsp;bioimage datasets more efficiently. It also aims to foster a common language between&nbsp;researchers and analysts, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and facilitating&nbsp;effective communication.

The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM) and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;
Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.
Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened the symposium were shared independently:

## I3D:bio's OMERO training material: Re-usable, adjustable, multi-purpose slides for local user training

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

## Image Repository Decision Tree - Where do I deposit my imaging data

Isabel Kemmer, Feriel Romdhane, Euro-BioImaging ERIC

Published 2025-05-15

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Depositing data in quality data repositories is one crucial step towards FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data. Accordingly, Euro-BioImaging strongly encourages sharing scientific imaging data in established, thematic repositories.&nbsp;
To guide you in the selection of appropriate repositories, we have created an overview of available repositories for different types of image data, including their scope and requirements. This decision tree guides you through questions about your data and directs you to the correct repository, and/or provides instructions for further processing to meet the critera of the repositories.&nbsp;
Three seperate trees are provided for different classes of imaging data: open bioimage data, preclinical data, and human imaging data. These versions with three trees can be used for web-view. Update: also the editable versions in powerpoint format (.pptx) are now provided. Please be aware that opening the versions with another program might lead to shifted formatting.
Update: we now also provide ready-to-print versions designed to be printed on A3 format. One page shows the open bioimaging data tree and one page combines the preclinical and human imaging data trees. Also the editable versions of these are provided.

Gemeinsames Arbeiten im Internet stellt uns vor neue Herausforderungen: Wer hat eine Datei wann hochgeladen? Wer hat zum Inhalt beigetragen? Wie kann man Inhalte zusammenfuehren, wenn mehrere Mitarbeiter gleichzeitig Aenderungen gemacht haben? Das Versionskontrollwerkzeug git stellt eine umfassende Loesung fuer solche Fragen bereit. Die Onlineplatform github.com stellt nicht nur Softwareentwicklern weltweit eine git-getriebene Platform zur Verfuegung und erlaubt ihnen effektiv zusammen zu arbeiten. In diesem Workshop lernen wir:

Infuerung in FAIR-Prinzipien im Softwarecontext
Arbeiten mit git: Pull-requests
Aufloesen von Merge-Konflikten
Automatisiertes Archivieren von Inhalten nach Zenodo.org
Eigene Webseiten auf github.io publizieren

Im Rahmen von FDM-SH Kontor &ndash; einem Projekt, das im Kontext der AG Kompetenzentwicklung von der Landesinitiative FDM-SH durchgef&uuml;hrt wurde - haben wir zum Ziel, eine kuratierte Materialbasis f&uuml;r Fortbildungen und Schulungen zu schaffen. Dies stellte uns vor die Herausforderung, festzulegen, wie die Materialien ausgew&auml;hlt werden sollen.
Dieser Kriterienkatalog ist ein Versuch, erste Qualit&auml;tskriterien (insbesondere hinsichtlich der Nachnutzbarkeit und den FAIR-Prinzipien) f&uuml;r Materialien auf Basis von Metadaten zu erstellen. Dabei wurde das Vorgehen des Open Science Learning Gates (https://zenodo.org/records/12772135), als Vorbild genommen. Neben dem Metadatenschema der RDA (https://zenodo.org/records/6769695#.YrrP9-xBybQ) haben wir auf das Metadatenschema der DINI/nestor UAG Schulungen/Fortbildungen (https://zenodo.org/records/3760398) sowie das DALIA Interchange Format (https://zenodo.org/records/11521029) zur&uuml;ckgegriffen.

## Learning and Training Bio-image Analysis in the Age of AI

Robert Haase

Published 2025-04-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT changes the way we analyse images. We ask LLMs to generate code, apply it to images and spend less time on learning implementation details. This also has impact on how we learn image analysis. While coding skills are still required, we can use LLMs to explain code, make proposals how to analyse the images and yet still decide how the analysis is done.

## NFDI4BIOIMAGE - National Research Data Infrastructure for Microscopy and Bioimage Analysis

NFDI4BIOIMAGE Consortium

Published 2024-08-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Bioimaging refers to a collection of methods to visualize the internal structures and mechanisms of living organisms. The fundamental tool, the microscope, has enabled seminal discoveries like that of the cell as the smallest unit of life, and continues to expand our understanding of biological processes. Today, we can follow the interaction of single molecules within nanoseconds in a living cell, and the development of complete small organisms like fish and flies over several days starting from the fertilized egg. Each image pixel encodes multiple spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions, compounding the massive volume and complexity of bioimage data. Proper handling of this data is indispensable for analysis and its lack has become a growing hindrance for the many disciplines of the life and biomedical sciences relying on bioimaging. No single domain has the expertise to tackle this bottleneck alone.
As a method-specific consortium, NFDI4BIOMAGE seeks to address these issues, enabling bioimaging data to be shared and re-used like they are acquired, i.e., independently of disciplinary boundaries. We will provide solutions for exploiting the full information content of bioimage data and enable new discoveries through sharing and re-analysis. Our RDM strategy is based on a robust needs analysis that derives not only from a community survey but also from over a decade of experience in German BioImaging, the German Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis. It considers the entire lifecycle of bioimaging data, from acquisition to archiving, including analysis and enabling re-use. A foundational element of this strategy is the definition of a common, cloud-compatible, and interoperable digital object that bundles binary images with their descriptive and provenance metadata. With members from plant biology to neuroscience, NFDI4BIOIMAGE will champion the standardization of bioimage data to create a framework that answers discipline-specific needs while ensuring communication and interoperability with data types and RDM systems across domains. Integration of bioimage data with, e.g., omics data as the basis for spatial omics, holds great promise for fields such as cancer medicine. Unlocking the full potential of bioimage data will rely on the development and broad availability of exceptional analysis tools and training sets. NFDI4BIOIMAGE will make these accessible and usable including cutting-edge AI-based methods in scalable cloud environments. NFDI4BIOIMAGE intersects with multiple NFDI consortia, most prominently with GHGA for linking image and genomics data and with DataPLANT on the definition of FAIR data objects. Last but not least, NFDI4BIOIMAGE is internationally well connected and represents the opportunity for German scientists to keep path with and have a voice in several international initiatives focusing on the FAIRification of bioimage data as one of the main challenges for the advancement of knowledge in the life and biomedical sciences.

## QM Course Lectures on Bio-Image Analysis with napari 2024

Marcelo Leomil Zoccoler

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In these lectures, we will explore ways to analyze microscopy images with Python and visualize them with napari, an nD viewer open-source software. The analysis will be done in Python mostly using the scikit-image, pyclesperanto and apoc libraries, via Jupyter notebooks. We will also explore some napari plugins as an interactive and convenient alternative way of performing these analysis, especially the napari-assistant, napari-apoc and napari-flim-phasor-plotter plugins.

Die Digitalisierung ermöglicht eine offene Wissenschaft (Open Science). Diese hat viele Aspekte, insbesondere den freien Zugang zu wissenschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen und Materialien (Open Access), transparente Begutachtungsverfahren (Open Peer Review) oder quelloffene Technologien (Open Source). Das Programm Hamburg Open Science (Laufzeit 2018–2020) unterstützt unter anderem den Kulturwandel in der Wissenschaft. In diesem Kontext entstand der nun vorliegende Leitfaden, der das rechtliche Umfeld greifbar machen soll. Der Leitfaden erarbeitet die betroffenen Rechtsgebiete zunächst systematisch. Im zweiten Teil werden rechtliche Fragen zu Open Science beantwortet, die direkt aus den Universitäten und Bibliotheken kommen.

The Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI) at the Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus (TU Dresden) is currently running a pilot project for testing the use and handling of the OMERO software. This is done together with interested users of the imaging facility and a research group. Currently, we are pushing forward this pilot study on a small scale without any data steward. Our experiences argue so far for giving data management issues into the hands of dedicated personnel not fully involved in research projects. As funding agencies will ask for higher and higher standards for implementing FAIRdata principles in the future, this will be a releva

Bioimage analysis (BIA), a crucial discipline in biological research, overcomes the limitations of subjective analysis in microscopy through the creation and application of quantitative and reproducible methods. The establishment of dedicated BIA support within academic institutions is vital to improving research quality and efficiency and can significantly advance scientific discovery. However, a lack of training resources, limited career paths and insufficient recognition of the contributions made by bioimage analysts prevent the full realization of this potential. This Perspective – the result of the recent The Company of Biologists Workshop ‘Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis’, which aimed to summarize the global BIA landscape, categorize obstacles and offer possible solutions – proposes strategies to bring about a cultural shift towards recognizing the value of BIA by standardizing tools, improving training and encouraging formal credit for contributions

## Towards open and standardised imaging data: an introduction to Bio-Formats, OME-TIFF, and OME-Zarr

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/towards-open-and-standardised-imaging-data-introduction-bio-formats-ome-tiff-and-ome-zarr/
Microscopy and bioimaging technologies are fundamental tools for exploring biological systems, generating large, multidimensional datasets rich in experimental detail. However, the bioimaging community has historically faced major challenges around data handling: vendor-specific proprietary formats, fragmented metadata storage, and increasingly large dataset sizes that outstrip traditional storage and computing solutions.
In this webinar, key open technologies developed by the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) to address these challenges were presented. Specifically, the Bio-Formats library for accessing diverse proprietary file formats, the OME-TIFF standard for archival data storage, and the OME-Zarr format for cloud-native, scalable bioimaging workflows were presented.

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



At the Center for Advanced Imaging (CAi) at the Heinrich Heine University D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, we have established a workflow to guide users through all aspects of bioimaging. The process begins with an initial consultation with our imaging specialists regarding microscopy techniques for their specific project. Users then receive training in microscope operation, ensuring they can handle the equipment effectively. If needed, our specialists also provide support in image analysis. Next, we introduce users to OMERO, highlighting its features and the advantages of using a bioimage data management system. They are then trained to structure and annotate their data within OMERO according to the Recommended Metadata for Biological Images (REMBI), taking their specific research topics into account. As users prepare for data publication, we assist with data organization and repository uploads. Our goal is to educate researchers in managing bioimage data&nbsp;throughout its entire lifecycle, with a strong emphasis on the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles.

## [ELMI2025] The Road to OME-Zarr 1.0

Josh Moore

Published 2025-06-05

Presented at https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/elmi2025/
&nbsp;
Abstract
For over 20 years, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) has developed tools and specifications to support bioimaging data sharing. Technologies such as Bio-Formats, OMERO, and OME-TIFF have helped researchers manage the growing size, complexity, and acquisition rates of imaging datasets. However, with increasing mandates for research data management, such as the Nelson memo in the United States, and the shift toward cloud-native workflows, the bioimaging community faces new challenges in ensuring scalable and FAIR data infrastructure.
In 2024, following expanding community engagement, the focus of the Next-Generation File Format (NGFF) community was on building consensus around a Request for Comments (RFC) process. This collaborative effort has laid the foundation for future refinements and wider adoption. In parallel, we hosted the &ldquo;OME2024 NGFF Challenge," bringing together over the course of just four months hundreds of terabytes of data in a first prototype of federated image hosting, showcasing the power of OME-Zarr for handling large-scale, distributed datasets.
In 2025, we are set to take a major step toward a stable FAIR solution with OME-Zarr 1.0. This milestone marks a crucial phase towards an international standard, providing an open, cloud-optimized, and scalable solution for handling terabyte- and petabyte-scale imaging data. The 1.0 release will introduce long-awaited transforms, enabling robust support for multimodal datasets, followed by collections and an extensibility mechanism to accommodate evolving scientific needs. These additions emphasize a solid foundation on which future capabilities can be built while providing the stability needed for broader adoption of the format. This presentation will outline the path to 1.0, including community-driven refinements, vendor engagement to ensure complete metadata representation, and alignment with global bioimaging initiatives. As imaging data continues to grow in scale and complexity, consensus-driven evolution of infrastructure will be key to ensuring a truly FAIR future for bioimaging.

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions
Establish a stakeholder process management for installing OMERO-based RDM
Learn from each other, leverage different expertise
Learn how to train users, establish sustainability strategies, and foster FAIR RDM for bioimaging at your institution

Published 2024-05-13

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024, at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)
Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.
Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation
Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji
Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks
Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with OMERO
The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection to their institutional networks to access OMERO
Who are the trainers?
Dr. Riccardo Massei (Helmholtz-Center for Environmental Research, UFZ, Leipzig) - Data Steward for Bioimaging Data in NFDI4BIOIMAGE

Description
Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:

Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining
Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO

The target group for this workshop
This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Who are the trainers (see trainer description below for more details)

Workshop Abstract:
Effective Research Data Management (RDM) requires collaboration between infrastructure providers, support units, and domain-specific experts across scientific disciplines. Microscopy, or bioimaging, is a widely used technology at universities and research institutions, generating large, multi-dimensional datasets. Scientists now routinely produce microscopy data using advanced imaging modalities, often through centrally-provided instruments maintained by core facilities.
Bioimaging data management presents unique challenges: files are often large (e.g., 15+ GB for whole slide images), come in various proprietary formats, and are accessed frequently for viewing as well as for complex image processing and analysis workflows. Collaboration between experimenters, clinicians, group leaders, core facility staff, and image analysts adds to the complexity, increasing the risk of data fragmentation and metadata loss.
The DFG-funded project I3D:bio and the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE, part of Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), are addressing these challenges by developing solutions and best practices for managing large, complex microscopy datasets. This workshop introduces the challenges of bioimaging RDM to institutional support personnel, including, for example, library staff, IT departments, and data stewards. Participants will explore the bioimaging RDM system OMERO, and apply structured metadata annotation and object-oriented data organization to a simple training dataset. OMERO offers centralized, secure access to data, allowing collaboration and reducing the data fragementation risk. Moreover, participants will experience the benefits of OME-Zarr, a chunked open file format designed for FAIR data sharing and remote access. OME-Zarr enables streaming of large, N-dimensional array-typed data over the Internet without the need to download whole files. An expanding toolbox for leveraging OME-Zarr for bioimaging data renders this file type a promising candidate for a standard file format suitable for use in FAIR Digital Object (FDO) implementations for microscopy data. OME-Zarr has become a pillar for imaging data sharing in two bioimaging-specific data repositories, i.e., the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the BioImage Archive (BIA). The team of Data Stewards from both abovenmentioned projects help researchers and research support staff to manage und publish bioimaging data.
By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained hands-on experience with bioimaging data and will be aware of support resources like the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Help Desk for addressing specific local use cases. Our goal is to promote collaboration across disciplines to effectively manage complex bioimaging data in compliance with the FAIR principles.
