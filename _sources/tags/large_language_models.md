Large Language Models (LLMs) change the way how we use computers. This also has impact on the bio-image analysis community. We can generate code that analyzes biomedical image data if we ask the right prompts. This talk outlines introduces basic principles, explains prompt engineering and how to apply it to bio-image analysis. We also compare how different LLM vendors perform on code generation tasks and which challenges are ahead for the bio-image analysis community.

Multimodal large language models have been recognized as a historical milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and have demonstrated revolutionary potentials not only in commercial applications, but also for many scientific fields. Here we give a brief overview of multimodal large language models through the lens of bioimage analysis and discuss how we could build these models as a community to facilitate biology research
