## QM Course Lectures on Bio-Image Analysis with napari 2024

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In these lectures, we will explore ways to analyze microscopy images with Python and visualize them with napari, an nD viewer open-source software. The analysis will be done in Python mostly using the scikit-image, pyclesperanto and apoc libraries, via Jupyter notebooks. We will also explore some napari plugins as an interactive and convenient alternative way of performing these analysis, especially the napari-assistant, napari-apoc and napari-flim-phasor-plotter plugins.
