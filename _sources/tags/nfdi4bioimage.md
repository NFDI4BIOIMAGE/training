Oral presentation, 32nd MoMAN &quot;From Molecules to Man&quot; Seminar, Ulm, online. Monday February 6th, 2023

Abstract:

Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects. To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats, data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.

In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification. German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities, research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice. &nbsp;

## Engineering a Software Environment for Research Data Management of Microscopy Image Data in a Core Facility

Kunis

Published 2022-05-30



This thesis deals with concepts and solutions in the field of data management in everyday scientific life for image data from microscopy. The focus of the formulated requirements has so far been on published data, which represent only a small subset of the data generated in the scientific process. More and more, everyday research data are moving into the focus of the principles for the management of research data that were formulated early on (FAIR-principles). The adequate management of this mostly multimodal data is a real challenge in terms of its heterogeneity and scope. There is a lack of standardised and established workflows and also the software solutions available so far do not adequately reflect the special requirements of this area. However, the success of any data management process depends heavily on the degree of integration into the daily work routine. Data management must, as far as possible, fit seamlessly into this process. Microscopy data in the scientific process is embedded in pre-processing, which consists of preparatory laboratory work and the analytical evaluation of the microscopy data. In terms of volume, the image data often form the largest part of data generated within this entire research process. In this paper, we focus on concepts and techniques related to the handling and description of this image data and address the necessary basics. The aim is to improve the embedding of the existing data management solution for image data (OMERO) into the everyday scientific work. For this purpose, two independent software extensions for OMERO were implemented within the framework of this thesis: OpenLink and MDEmic. OpenLink simplifies the access to the data stored in the integrated repository in order to feed them into established workflows for further evaluations and enables not only the internal but also the external exchange of data without weakening the advantages of the data repository. The focus of the second implemented software solution, MDEmic, is on the capturing of relevant metadata for microscopy. Through the extended metadata collection, a corresponding linking of the multimodal data by means of a unique description and the corresponding semantic background is aimed at. The configurability of MDEmic is designed to address the currently very dynamic development of underlying concepts and formats. The main goal of MDEmic is to minimise the workload and to automate processes. This provides the scientist with a tool to handle this complex and extensive task of metadata acquisition for microscopic data in a simple way. With the help of the software, semantic and syntactic standardisation can take place without the scientist having to deal with the technical concepts. The generated metadata descriptions are automatically integrated into the image repository and, at the same time, can be transferred by the scientists into formats that are needed when publishing the data.

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

## Key-Value pair template for annotation in OMERO for light microscopy data acquired with AxioScan7 - Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI)

Silke Tulok, Anja Nobst, Anett Jannasch, Tom Boissonnet, Gunar Fabig

Published 2024-06-28

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This Key-Value pair template is used for the data documentation during imaging experiments and the later data annotation in OMERO. It is tailored for the usage and image acquisition at the slide scanning system Zeiss AxioScan 7 in the Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI). It contains important metadata of the imaging experiment, which are not saved in the corresponding imaging files. All users of the Core Facility Cellular Imaging are trained to use that file to document their imaging parameters directly during the data acquisition with the possibility for a later upload to OMERO. Furthermore, there is a corresponding public example image used in the publication "Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users" and is available here:
https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=image-33248
This template was developed by the CFCI staff during the setup and usage of the AxioScan 7 and is based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015).
With this template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate an image or dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).
How to use:

fill the template sheet&nbsp; with your metadata
select and copy the data range containing the Keys and Values
open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in cell A1&nbsp;
Important: cell A1 contains always the name 'dataset' and cell A2 contains the exact name of the image/dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv-file (comma separated values) format

An example can be seen in sheet 3 'csv_AxioScan'.
Important note: The code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might be not able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft-Office versions (MS Office 2016).&nbsp;
Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of comma as decimal delimiter.

open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in column B1
type in A1 'dataset'
insert in A2 the exact name of the dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv- (comma seperated values) file format

Example can be seen in sheet 1 'csv import'. Important note; the code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might not be able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft Office versions (e.g. MS Office 2016).&nbsp;

Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing, researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.

Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) aims to establish a sustained, cross-disciplinary research data management (RDM) infrastructure that enables researchers to handle FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data. While&nbsp;FAIR principles have been&nbsp;adopted by funders, policymakers, and publishers, their practical implementation remains an ongoing effort. In the field of bio-imaging, harmonization of&nbsp;data formats, metadata ontologies, and open data repositories is necessary&nbsp;to achieve FAIR data.&nbsp;The NFDI4BIOIMAGE was established&nbsp;to address these issues and&nbsp;develop tools and best practices to facilitate FAIR microscopy and image analysis data in alignment with international community activities. The&nbsp;consortium operates through its Data Stewards team to provide expertise and direct support to help overcome RDM challenges. The three Helmholtz Centers in NFDI4BIOIMAGE aim to collaborate closely with other centers and initiatives, such as HMC, Helmholtz AI, and HIP. Here we present NFDI4BIOIMAGE&rsquo;s work and its significance for research in Helmholtz and beyond

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions
Establish a stakeholder process management for installing OMERO-based RDM
Learn from each other, leverage different expertise
Learn how to train users, establish sustainability strategies, and foster FAIR RDM for bioimaging at your institution

## [Workshop] Bioimage data management and analysis with OMERO

Riccardo Massei, Michele Bortolomeazzi, Christian Schmidt

Published 2024-05-13

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024, at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)
Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.
Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation
Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji
Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks
Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with OMERO
The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection to their institutional networks to access OMERO
Who are the trainers?
Dr. Riccardo Massei (Helmholtz-Center for Environmental Research, UFZ, Leipzig) - Data Steward for Bioimaging Data in NFDI4BIOIMAGE
Dr. Michele Bortolomeazzi (DKFZ, Single cell Open Lab, bioimage data specialist, bioinformatician, staff scientist in the NFDI4BIOIMAGE project)
