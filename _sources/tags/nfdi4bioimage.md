Oral presentation, 32nd MoMAN &quot;From Molecules to Man&quot; Seminar, Ulm, online. Monday February 6th, 2023

Abstract:

Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects. To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats, data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.

In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification. German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities, research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice. &nbsp;

## Accessible Interactive Spatial-Omics Data Visualizations with Vitessce and OMERO

Bortolomeazzi Michele

Published 2025-06-30

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.

## Bioimaging workflow based on OMERO, eLabFTW, and Adamant for integrating images with multimodal metadata

Mohsen Ahmadi, Robert Wagner, Sander Bekeschus, Becker, Markus M.

Published 2025-07-29

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This research data management workflow for bioimaging is designed to bridge the gap between image metadata and experimental / process metadata. By linking images and microscopy-related metadata with broader experimental records, the workflow particularly supports the adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in interdisciplinary fields where bioimaging is used to analyse treated samples requiring multimodal metadata. A Jupyter Notebook guides the user through the metadata level, data handling level, and data processing level and connects various software components in a modular manner. On the metadata level, microscope-specific metadata are captured using the Micro-Meta App and stored as reusable digital assets. Adamant provides a user interface to collect and process schema-based metadata related to the experiment / treatment procedure. Structured imaging and process metadata are attached to the complete experiment description in eLabFTW. On the data handling level, OMERO serves as the central platform for storing and managing microscopy images together with their metadata retrieved from eLabFTW (workflow with ELN) or directly from JSON files (workflow without ELN). On the data processing level, OMERO supports both automated and manual image analysis either directly via the Jupyter Notebook or FIJI. Due to the modularity of the workflow, the integrated tools can be substituted with equivalent systems based on institutional / user requirements. Whether in teaching or research settings, this workflow supports high-throughput, reproducible imaging workflows, ensuring that data, metadata, and analysis steps remain transparent, interoperable, and reusable across diverse bioimage analysis platforms.

## Cloud-Based Virtual Desktops for Reproducible Research

Yi Sun, Christian Tischer, Kelleher, Harry Alexander, Jean-Karim Heriche

Published 2025-09-10

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Reproducing computing environments become increasingly challenging in research, especially when compute-intensive scientific workflows require specialised software stacks, specialized hardware (e.g. GPUs), and interactive analysis tools. While traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems offer scalable resources for batch processing, they don't easily support interactive workflows. On the other hand, workstations have fixed resources  and face workflow deployment challenges because conflicts can occur when multiple tools and dependencies are deployed into the same environment. To address these limitations, we present cloud-based virtual desktop platforms, built on the desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) model, using a containerised, cloud-native approach.  Our platforms offer on-demand, customized desktop environments accessible from any web browser, with dynamic allocation of CPU, memory, and GPU resources for efficient utilization of resources. We introduce two types of virtual desktops: BAND, built on top of a Slurm scheduler and BARD, using Kubernetes. In both cases, containerization ensures consistent and reproducible environments across sessions and pre-installed software improves accessibility for researchers. Deployment and system administration are also simplified through the use of orchestration and automation tools.  Our virtual desktop platforms are particularly valuable for bioimage analysis, which requires complex workflows involving high interactivity, multiple software and GPU acceleration. By combining containerization and cloud-native services, BAND and BARD offer a scalable and sustainable model for delivering interactive, reproducible research environments.

Interdisciplinary collaboration and integration of large and diverse datasets are becoming increasingly important. Answering complex research questions requires combining and analysing multimodal datasets. Research data management follows the FAIR principles making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. However, there are challenges in capturing the entire research cycle and contextualizing data according, not only for the DataPLANT and NFDI4BIOIMAGE communities. To address these challenges, DataPLANT developed a data structure called Annotated Research Context (ARC). The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) originated from the neuroimaging community extended for microscopic image data. Both concepts provide standardised and file system based data storage structures for organising and sharing research data accompanied with metadata. We exemplarily compare the ARC and BIDS designs and propose structural and metadata mapping.

Imaging is crucial across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences, where it plays a key role in studies ranging from single molecules to whole organisms. However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data present significant challenges. Managing and analyzing this data efficiently requires well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR principles—ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable across different domains. In the frame of NFDI4BIOIMAGE1 (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing, analyzing, and sharing bioimaging data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to make findable and machine-readable metadata developing analysis pipelines. In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity, supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata. Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis2. By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases the efficiency of RDM processes in bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific community's efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation. In the present poster, we showed how to integrate RDM processes and tools in Galaxy. We will showcase how Images can be enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to a target OME Remote Objects (OMERO) server using a novel set of OMERO tools developed with Galaxy3. Workflows give the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and perform image analysis (i.e. annotation). Furthermore, we will show the potential integration of eletronic lab books such as eLabFTW4, cloud storage systems (i.e. OneData)5 and interactive norebooks (Jupyter Notebooks) 6 in the Galaxy pipeline.

## Engineering a Software Environment for Research Data Management of Microscopy Image Data in a Core Facility

Kunis

Published 2022-05-30



This thesis deals with concepts and solutions in the field of data management in everyday scientific life for image data from microscopy. The focus of the formulated requirements has so far been on published data, which represent only a small subset of the data generated in the scientific process. More and more, everyday research data are moving into the focus of the principles for the management of research data that were formulated early on (FAIR-principles). The adequate management of this mostly multimodal data is a real challenge in terms of its heterogeneity and scope. There is a lack of standardised and established workflows and also the software solutions available so far do not adequately reflect the special requirements of this area. However, the success of any data management process depends heavily on the degree of integration into the daily work routine. Data management must, as far as possible, fit seamlessly into this process. Microscopy data in the scientific process is embedded in pre-processing, which consists of preparatory laboratory work and the analytical evaluation of the microscopy data. In terms of volume, the image data often form the largest part of data generated within this entire research process. In this paper, we focus on concepts and techniques related to the handling and description of this image data and address the necessary basics. The aim is to improve the embedding of the existing data management solution for image data (OMERO) into the everyday scientific work. For this purpose, two independent software extensions for OMERO were implemented within the framework of this thesis: OpenLink and MDEmic. OpenLink simplifies the access to the data stored in the integrated repository in order to feed them into established workflows for further evaluations and enables not only the internal but also the external exchange of data without weakening the advantages of the data repository. The focus of the second implemented software solution, MDEmic, is on the capturing of relevant metadata for microscopy. Through the extended metadata collection, a corresponding linking of the multimodal data by means of a unique description and the corresponding semantic background is aimed at. The configurability of MDEmic is designed to address the currently very dynamic development of underlying concepts and formats. The main goal of MDEmic is to minimise the workload and to automate processes. This provides the scientist with a tool to handle this complex and extensive task of metadata acquisition for microscopic data in a simple way. With the help of the software, semantic and syntactic standardisation can take place without the scientist having to deal with the technical concepts. The generated metadata descriptions are automatically integrated into the image repository and, at the same time, can be transferred by the scientists into formats that are needed when publishing the data.

The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

omero-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data viewing.
OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.
The three files in this Zenodo Record are all the same poster saved in different format all with high resolution images.

## Key-Value pair template for annotation in OMERO for light microscopy data acquired with AxioScan7 - Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI)

Silke Tulok, Anja Nobst, Anett Jannasch, Tom Boissonnet, Gunar Fabig

Published 2024-06-28

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



This Key-Value pair template is used for the data documentation during imaging experiments and the later data annotation in OMERO. It is tailored for the usage and image acquisition at the slide scanning system Zeiss AxioScan 7 in the Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI). It contains important metadata of the imaging experiment, which are not saved in the corresponding imaging files. All users of the Core Facility Cellular Imaging are trained to use that file to document their imaging parameters directly during the data acquisition with the possibility for a later upload to OMERO. Furthermore, there is a corresponding public example image used in the publication "Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users" and is available here:
https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=image-33248
This template was developed by the CFCI staff during the setup and usage of the AxioScan 7 and is based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015).
With this template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate an image or dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).
How to use:

fill the template sheet&nbsp; with your metadata
select and copy the data range containing the Keys and Values
open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in cell A1&nbsp;
Important: cell A1 contains always the name 'dataset' and cell A2 contains the exact name of the image/dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv-file (comma separated values) format

An example can be seen in sheet 3 'csv_AxioScan'.
Important note: The code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might be not able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft-Office versions (MS Office 2016).&nbsp;
Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of comma as decimal delimiter.

## Linking of Research (Meta-)data in OMERO to Foster FAIR Data in Plasma Science

Robert Wagner, Mohsen Ahmadi, Dagmar Waltemath, Kristina Yordanova, Becker, Markus M.

Published 2025-09-10

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Applied plasma research involves several disciplines such as physics, medicine and biology to solve application-oriented problems, often generating large and heterogeneous experimental data sets. The descriptions and metadata describing these interdisciplinary scientific investiga-tions is stored in distributed systems (e.g., physical laboratory notebooks or electronic labora-tory notebooks (ELN) like eLabFTW [1]), and the experimental data are either stored locally within the laboratories or on centralized institutional storage systems. As a result, the collected information often has to be tediously assembled for processing into publications. The workflow represented in Figure 1 addresses this suboptimal situation and promotes the combination of the image database OMERO [2], the ELN system eLabFTW, the research data management tool Adamant [3] and Python scripts for handling microscopy images in plasma life science and plasma medicine [4]. This workflow highlights how the developments from the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consortium can be brought into practical applications by addressing the specific demands of plasma science, where domain-specific metadata is essential for effective data interpretation and reuse. It showcases the benefits of FAIR [5] metadata combining do-main-specific requirements with method-specific solutions. Similar to most imaging workflows, image analysis in plasma research requires metadata from several sections of the experiment. Moreover, the plasma-related metadata are essential for the experimental context and must be included in the analysis, e.g. to describe the influence of plasma on the treated sample. Therefore, the metadata schema Plasma-MDS [6] is adapted to collect plasma-related metadata, such as information on the plasma species having a major impact on the treated samples. Alongside Plasma-MDS, the Recommended Metadata for Bio-logical Images (REMBI) standard [7] is used for the biological metadata such as the sample preparation and treatment procedures. The collection of these metadata is realized using Adamant, which enables the beginner-friendly collection of structured metadata. The tool presents JSON schemas in easy-to-read and easy-to-fill HTML forms, enabling metadata validation. Once completed and validated, the metadata are uploaded directly to eLabFTW using Adamant's workflow functionalities. The images from the treated samples are uploaded to OMERO by OMERO.insight and afterwards automatically annotated via Python scripts. These scripts take previously collected metadata from the related eLabFTW experiments and the microscope description metadata collected by the Micro Meta App [8], which are also stored in eLabFTW. The metadata is categorized and annotated according to the various data organizational levels within OMERO, specifically fo-cusing on project and dataset hierarchies, as well as screens that are composed of plates, which in turn contain wells. Screens resemble microwell plates, commonly used in a variety of biological experiments. The hieraic organization of metadata significantly enhances the ease of reusing images and associated metadata for subsequent processing and analysis. By efficiently distributing and reducing large metadata sets to an acceptable level, while simultaneously eliminating redun-dancies, this approach facilitates straightforward analyses with tools like ImageJ [9] and FIJI [10], thanks to the close association of metadata with the images themselves. In summary, one of the application-specific developments within the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consor-tium is presented, which contributes to the adoption of the FAIR principles in laboratory envi-ronments. Further work will address the integration of ontologies for the semantic description of data and metadata.

Research data management (RDM) in microscopy and image analysis is a challenging task. Large files in proprietary formats, complex N-dimensional array structures, and various metadata models and formats can make image data handling inconvenient and difficult. For data organization, annotation, and sharing, researchers need solutions that fit everyday practice and comply with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. International community-based efforts have begun creating open data models (OME), an open file format and translation library (OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats), data management software platforms, and microscopy metadata recommendations and annotation tools. Bringing these developments into practice requires support and training. Iterative feedback and tool&nbsp;improvement is needed to foster practical adoption by the scientific&nbsp;community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project&nbsp;works on guidelines, training resources, and practical assistance for FAIR&nbsp;microscopy RDM adoption with a focus on the management platform OMERO&nbsp;and metadata annotations.

Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) aims to establish a sustained, cross-disciplinary research data management (RDM) infrastructure that enables researchers to handle FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data. While&nbsp;FAIR principles have been&nbsp;adopted by funders, policymakers, and publishers, their practical implementation remains an ongoing effort. In the field of bio-imaging, harmonization of&nbsp;data formats, metadata ontologies, and open data repositories is necessary&nbsp;to achieve FAIR data.&nbsp;The NFDI4BIOIMAGE was established&nbsp;to address these issues and&nbsp;develop tools and best practices to facilitate FAIR microscopy and image analysis data in alignment with international community activities. The&nbsp;consortium operates through its Data Stewards team to provide expertise and direct support to help overcome RDM challenges. The three Helmholtz Centers in NFDI4BIOIMAGE aim to collaborate closely with other centers and initiatives, such as HMC, Helmholtz AI, and HIP. Here we present NFDI4BIOIMAGE&rsquo;s work and its significance for research in Helmholtz and beyond

Microscopy and bioimaging technologies are fundamental tools for exploring biological systems, generating large, multidimensional datasets rich in experimental detail. However, the bioimaging community has historically faced major challenges around data handling: vendor-specific proprietary formats, fragmented metadata storage, and increasingly large dataset sizes that outstrip traditional storage and computing solutions.
In this webinar, key open technologies developed by the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) to address these challenges were presented. Specifically, the Bio-Formats library for accessing diverse proprietary file formats, the OME-TIFF standard for archival data storage, and the OME-Zarr format for cloud-native, scalable bioimaging workflows were presented.

At the Center for Advanced Imaging (CAi) at the Heinrich Heine University D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, we have established a workflow to guide users through all aspects of bioimaging. The process begins with an initial consultation with our imaging specialists regarding microscopy techniques for their specific project. Users then receive training in microscope operation, ensuring they can handle the equipment effectively. If needed, our specialists also provide support in image analysis. Next, we introduce users to OMERO, highlighting its features and the advantages of using a bioimage data management system. They are then trained to structure and annotate their data within OMERO according to the Recommended Metadata for Biological Images (REMBI), taking their specific research topics into account. As users prepare for data publication, we assist with data organization and repository uploads. Our goal is to educate researchers in managing bioimage data&nbsp;throughout its entire lifecycle, with a strong emphasis on the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles.

For decades, the sharing of large N-dimensional datasets has posed issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or down-sampled representations on the fly. Now, a cloud-native chunked format easing this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The format — Zarr — is potentially of interest for other consortia and sections of NFDI.

## [ELMI2025] The Road to OME-Zarr 1.0

Josh Moore

Published 2025-06-05

Presented at https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/elmi2025/
&nbsp;
Abstract
For over 20 years, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) has developed tools and specifications to support bioimaging data sharing. Technologies such as Bio-Formats, OMERO, and OME-TIFF have helped researchers manage the growing size, complexity, and acquisition rates of imaging datasets. However, with increasing mandates for research data management, such as the Nelson memo in the United States, and the shift toward cloud-native workflows, the bioimaging community faces new challenges in ensuring scalable and FAIR data infrastructure.
In 2024, following expanding community engagement, the focus of the Next-Generation File Format (NGFF) community was on building consensus around a Request for Comments (RFC) process. This collaborative effort has laid the foundation for future refinements and wider adoption. In parallel, we hosted the &ldquo;OME2024 NGFF Challenge," bringing together over the course of just four months hundreds of terabytes of data in a first prototype of federated image hosting, showcasing the power of OME-Zarr for handling large-scale, distributed datasets.
In 2025, we are set to take a major step toward a stable FAIR solution with OME-Zarr 1.0. This milestone marks a crucial phase towards an international standard, providing an open, cloud-optimized, and scalable solution for handling terabyte- and petabyte-scale imaging data. The 1.0 release will introduce long-awaited transforms, enabling robust support for multimodal datasets, followed by collections and an extensibility mechanism to accommodate evolving scientific needs. These additions emphasize a solid foundation on which future capabilities can be built while providing the stability needed for broader adoption of the format. This presentation will outline the path to 1.0, including community-driven refinements, vendor engagement to ensure complete metadata representation, and alignment with global bioimaging initiatives. As imaging data continues to grow in scale and complexity, consensus-driven evolution of infrastructure will be key to ensuring a truly FAIR future for bioimaging.

Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together to enable RDM for bioimaging
Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions
Establish a stakeholder process management for installing OMERO-based RDM
Learn from each other, leverage different expertise

Published 2024-05-13

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024, at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)
Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.
Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation
Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji
Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks
Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with OMERO
The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection to their institutional networks to access OMERO
Who are the trainers?
Dr. Riccardo Massei (Helmholtz-Center for Environmental Research, UFZ, Leipzig) - Data Steward for Bioimaging Data in NFDI4BIOIMAGE

Effective Research Data Management (RDM) requires collaboration between infrastructure providers, support units, and domain-specific experts across scientific disciplines. Microscopy, or bioimaging, is a widely used technology at universities and research institutions, generating large, multi-dimensional datasets. Scientists now routinely produce microscopy data using advanced imaging modalities, often through centrally-provided instruments maintained by core facilities.
Bioimaging data management presents unique challenges: files are often large (e.g., 15+ GB for whole slide images), come in various proprietary formats, and are accessed frequently for viewing as well as for complex image processing and analysis workflows. Collaboration between experimenters, clinicians, group leaders, core facility staff, and image analysts adds to the complexity, increasing the risk of data fragmentation and metadata loss.
The DFG-funded project I3D:bio and the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE, part of Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), are addressing these challenges by developing solutions and best practices for managing large, complex microscopy datasets. This workshop introduces the challenges of bioimaging RDM to institutional support personnel, including, for example, library staff, IT departments, and data stewards. Participants will explore the bioimaging RDM system OMERO, and apply structured metadata annotation and object-oriented data organization to a simple training dataset. OMERO offers centralized, secure access to data, allowing collaboration and reducing the data fragementation risk. Moreover, participants will experience the benefits of OME-Zarr, a chunked open file format designed for FAIR data sharing and remote access. OME-Zarr enables streaming of large, N-dimensional array-typed data over the Internet without the need to download whole files. An expanding toolbox for leveraging OME-Zarr for bioimaging data renders this file type a promising candidate for a standard file format suitable for use in FAIR Digital Object (FDO) implementations for microscopy data. OME-Zarr has become a pillar for imaging data sharing in two bioimaging-specific data repositories, i.e., the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the BioImage Archive (BIA). The team of Data Stewards from both abovenmentioned projects help researchers and research support staff to manage und publish bioimaging data.
By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained hands-on experience with bioimaging data and will be aware of support resources like the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Help Desk for addressing specific local use cases. Our goal is to promote collaboration across disciplines to effectively manage complex bioimaging data in compliance with the FAIR principles.
