## Towards community-driven metadata standards for light microscopy - tiered specifications extending the OME model

Mathias Hammer, Maximiliaan Huisman, Alessandro Rigano, Ulrike Boehm, James J. Chambers, et al.

Published 2022-07-10

Licensed UNKNOWN



Rigorous record-keeping and quality control are required to ensure the quality, reproducibility and value of imaging data. The 4DN Initiative and BINA here propose light Microscopy Metadata specifications that extend the OME data model, scale with experimental intent and complexity, and make it possible for scientists to create comprehensive records of imaging experiments.
