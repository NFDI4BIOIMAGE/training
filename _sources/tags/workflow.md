## Galaxy workflows

Licensed CC0-1.0



A workflow is a chain of analysis steps. In Galaxy, we can create a workflow from an existing analysis history, or we can create one visually by adding tools to a canvas. This tutorial covers building a workflow to analyse a bacterial genome, from input FASTQ sequencing reads to assembly, annotation, and visualization.

['Shanghang Zhang', 'Gaole Dai', 'Tiejun Huang', 'Jianxu Chen']

Licensed ['CC-BY-NC-SA']



Multimodal large language models have been recognized as a historical milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and have demonstrated revolutionary potentials not only in commercial applications, but also for many scientific fields. Here we give a brief overview of multimodal large language models through the lens of bioimage analysis and discuss how we could build these models as a community to facilitate biology research
