The dynamic field of bioimage analysis continually seeks innovative tools to democratize access to analysis tools and its documentation. The BioImage.IO Chatbot, leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), provides an interactive platform that significantly integrates the exploration and application of bioimage analysis tools and models. This seminar will introduce the BioImage.IO Chatbot's capabilities, focusing on how it facilitates access to advanced analysis tools and documentation, allows for the execution of complex models, and enables users to create customized extensions adjusted to specific research needs. In a live demo, attendees will see how to interact with the chatbot and all its assistants and capabilities. Join us to explore how the BioImage.IO Chatbot ca transform your research by making sophisticated analysis more intuitive and accessible.

When training people in topics such as programming, bio-image analysis or data science, it makes sense to define a training strategy with a wider perspective than just trainees needs. This slide deck gives insights into aspects to consider when defining a training strategy. It considers funder's interests, financial aspects, metrics / goals, steps towards sustainability and opportunities for outreach and for founding future collaborations.

Published 2025-02-28

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



GloBIAS seminar series
&nbsp;
Part 3 in the topic:&nbsp;
Infrastructure for deploying image analysis workflows
Image analysis using Galaxy

Beatrix Serrano-Solano, Euro-BioImaging ERIC Bio-Hub, EMBL Heidelberg, Germany
&amp; Anne Fouilloux , Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway
&amp; Leonid Kostrykin, Biomedical Computer Vision Group, Heidelberg University, BioQuant, IPMB, Heidelberg, Germany
&amp; Ricardo Massei, Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research, UFZ, Leipzig, Germany
Abstract: This webinar will introduce the Galaxy Image Analysis Community and highlight our mission to advance the development of FAIR and reproducible image analysis workflows. As part of our commitment to making image data analysis more accessible and collaborative, we will showcase how Galaxy can serve the imaging community. The session will explore Galaxy&rsquo;s capabilities for integrating popular image analysis tools, interactive environments, and notebooks, making it a versatile platform for researchers across various scientific domains. We will also present how Galaxy facilitates the creation and sharing of reusable workflows, promoting open science and fostering collaboration. To give participants hands-on insight, we&rsquo;ll provide a live demonstration on designing and running image analysis workflows within Galaxy.&nbsp;

Raw microscopy image from the NFDI4Bioimage calendar March 2025.
The image shows 125x magnified microscopic details of a biofilm formed by Pseudomonas fluorescence on the surface of a liquid culture medium. The culture was inoculated with a cellulose-overexpressing and surface-colonizing mScarlet-tagged wild type and a GFP-tagged mutant that is unable to colonize the surface. The biofilm can collapse over time due to its own mass, so that new strategies have to be developed and thus a life cycle emerges.

Acquired with an Nikon SIM, in 2D-SIM mode at 488nm of excitation with 30% laser power and 200ms of exposition.&nbsp; Fluorescence is a knocked-in mStayGold-&beta;2Spectrin. Cells are rat hippocampal neurons &agrave; DIV 3. The file is a reconstructed multiposition acquisition (10 positions). Uploaded to show a probable issue with Bio-Formats in Fiji, where SIM reconstrcuted multipositions files open like static noise.&nbsp;
