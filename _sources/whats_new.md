CellBinDB is a large-scale, multimodal annotated dataset for cell segmentation. It contains 1,044 annotated microscope images and 109,083 cell annotations, covering four staining types: DAPI, ssDNA, H&amp;E, and mIF. CellBinDB contains samples from two species, human and mouse, covering more than 30 histologically different tissue types, including disease-related tissues. The images in CellBinDB come from two sources: 844 mouse images from internal experiments and 200 human images from the open access platform 10x Genomics. We annotated all images in CellBinDB and provide two types of image annotations: semantic and instance masks. A xlsx file is attached to record the detailed information of each image.
In addition, we provide the images and annotations of nine other widely used publicly available cell segmentation datasets downloaded from their original sources, retaining their original formats for ease of use.&nbsp;
The file 'mixed_licenses.txt' contains the original accessions of the public datasets used in our project and their associated licenses. Please refer to these links for more information about each dataset and its licensing terms, and use it according to the specifications.

## Learning and Training Bio-image Analysis in the Age of AI

Robert Haase

Published 2025-04-07

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT changes the way we analyse images. We ask LLMs to generate code, apply it to images and spend less time on learning implementation details. This also has impact on how we learn image analysis. While coding skills are still required, we can use LLMs to explain code, make proposals how to analyse the images and yet still decide how the analysis is done.

## LyNSeC: Lymphoma Nuclear Segmentation and Classification

Naji Hussein, Büttner Reinhard, Simon Adrian, Eich Marie-Lisa, Lohneis Philipp, Bozek Katarzyna

Published 2023-06-21

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Over the last years, there has been large progress in automated segmentation and classification methods in histological whole slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Current state-of-the-art techniques are based on diverse datasets of H&amp;E-stained WSIs of different types of predominantly solid cancer. However, there is a lack of publicly available annotated datasets of lymphoma, which is why we generated a labeled diffuse large B-cell lymphoma dataset and denoted it LyNSeC (lymphoma nuclear segmentation and classification). LyNSeC comprises three subsets: LyNSeC 1 consists of 379 IHC images of size 512 x 512 pixels at 40x magnification. In the images, we annotated the contours of each cell nuclei and the cell class: marker-positive or marker-negative.

In total, LyNSeC 1 contains 87,316 annotated cell nuclei of four different cases, with 48,171 of them assigned the class negative and 39,145 positive. We included three markers in this dataset showing visually different staining patterns: cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), Ki67 as a marker of proliferation, and erythroblast transformation-specific (EST)-related gene (ERG).

LyNSeC 2 and 3 contain H&amp;E-stained images of 70 different patients. LyNSeC 2 consists of 280 images and LyNSeC 3 of 40 images of size 512 x 512 pixels at 40x magnification. 65,479 and 8,452 nuclei were annotated in LyNSeC 2 and 3, respectively. In LyNSeC 3, the nuclei were also assigned a class label (tumor and non-tumor). 3,747 nuclei were identified as tumors and 4,705 as non-tumors.

In the annotation procedure, the contours of the H&amp;E images (LyNSeC 2 and LyNSeC 3) were annotated by two pathologists and by two students (trained by the pathologists). Annotation of the cell classes in LyNSeC 3 was done by the pathologists only. LyNSeC 1 was annotated by the two students who were additionally trained to annotate the contours and to distinguish marker-positive and marker-negative cells. The pathologists inspected and (if necessary) adjusted the LyNSeC 3 annotations.

The files are uploaded in &#39;.npy&#39; format. The files of LyNSeC 1 (x_l1.npy) and LyNSeC 3&nbsp;(x_l3.npy) contain five channels, respectively: the first three are the RGB channels of the images, channel 4 contains the instance maps, and channel 5 the class type maps (for LyNSeC 1 a pixel value of 1 corresponds to the class negative and 2 to the class positive, whereas in LyNSeC 3 1 corresponds to the class non-tumor and 2 to the class tumor). The files of LyNSeC 2 (x_l2.npy) have 4 channels (without the class type map).

Additionally, we also make our HoVer-Net-based pre-trained nuclei segmentation and classification models available (he.tar for H&amp;E images and ihc.tar for IHC images).

## Melanoma Histopathology Dataset with Tissue and Nuclei Annotations

Mark Schuiveling

Published 2025-03-19

Licensed CC-ZERO



Description:
This dataset is designed for development of deep learning models for segmentation of nuclei and tissue in melanoma H&amp;E stained histopathology. Existing nuclei segmentation models that are trained on non-melanoma specific datasets have low performance due to the ability of melanocytes to mimic other cell types, whereas existing melanoma specific models utilize older, sub-optimal techniques. Moreover, these models do not provide tissue annotations necessary for determining the localization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which may hold value for predictive and prognostic tasks. To address this, we created a melanoma specific dataset with nuclei and tissue annotations.&nbsp;
Methodology:
Sample Collection:
Regions of interest (ROIs) were sampled from H&amp;E stained slides of 103 primary melanoma specimens and 102 metastatic melanoma specimens, scanned using a Hamamatsu scanner at 40&times; magnification (0.23 &mu;m per pixel). All slides were obtained from regular diagnostic procedures.From each specimen, a 40&times; magnified ROI of 1024&times;1024 pixels was selected for annotation. Additionally, a context ROI of 5120&times;5120 pixels was sampled to provide information about the broader context for the annotation process. Selection was performed by a trained medical expert (M.S.) and subsequently verified by a dermatopathologist (W.B.). Manual ROI selection ensured the inclusion of diverse tissue and nuclei types.
Annotation Process:

Nuclei segmentationNuclei segmentations were generated using Hover-Net pretrained on the PanNuke dataset. Manual annotation adjustments were performed by author M.S. using QuPath, with the following nuclei categories: tumor, stroma, vascular endothelium, histiocyte, melanophage, lymphocyte, plasma cell, neutrophil, apoptotic cell, and epithelium. All annotations were reviewed and corrected, where needed, by a dermatopathologist (W.B.).
Tissue segmentationTissue segmentations were created manually using QuPath by M.S., with the following categories: tumor, stroma, epidermis, necrosis, blood vessel, and background. Annotations were reviewed and corrected, where needed, by a dermatopathologist (W.B.).

Quality Control: To assess the reliability of the annotations, intra- and interobserver agreement (by pathologist G.B.) were determined on 12 randomly selected ROIs.

Nuclei segmentationThe intraobserver overall precision was 84.89%, with a recall of 86.45%, and an F1 score of 85.66%. Interobserver overall precision was 80.34%, with a recall of 80.62%, and an F1 score of 80.20%. These results are based on the sum of all true positive, false positive, and false negative counts for the 12 ROIs.
Tissue segmentationThe DICE score was determined on the same 12 randomly selected ROIs. The average intraobserver DICE score was 0.90, and the interobserver DICE score was also 0.90.

&nbsp;
Version 3:Removed sample "training_set_metastatic_roi_103" due to inconsistencies in annotation file.
Version 4:Sample training_set_metastatic_roi_088 missed one color annotation for a nuclei_apoptosis in the geojson file rendering it qupath uncompatible. This is fixed in the new version.&nbsp;
Version 5:Addition of correct sample of training_set_metastatic_roi_103" after deadline of panoptic segmentation of nuclei and tissue in advanced melanoma challenge test phase.&nbsp;

This is an instance segmentation task where each cell has an individual label under the same category (cells). The training set contains both labeled images and unlabeled images. You can only use the labeled images to develop your model but we encourage participants to try to explore the unlabeled images through weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning.
&nbsp;
The images are provided with original formats, including tiff, tif, png, jpg, bmp... The original formats contain the most amount of information for competitors and you have free choice over different normalization methods. For the ground truth, we standardize them as tiff formats.
&nbsp;
We aim to maintain this challenge as a sustainable benchmark platform. If you find the top algorithms (https://neurips22-cellseg.grand-challenge.org/awards/) don't perform well on your images, welcome to send us the dataset (neurips.cellseg@gmail.com)! We will include them in the new testing set and credit your contributions on the challenge website!
