Summary:
The BioImage Analysis and Superresolution Microscopy Workshop 2023 took place at Dartmouth College, offering participants a comprehensive learning experience in the field of bioimage analysis and superresolution microscopy. Over the course of two days, researchers, scientists, and students immersed themselves in cutting-edge microscopy techniques and expanded their knowledge and practical skills.

Day 1 (Tue, June 6):
The workshop began with Zdenek Svindrych providing an overview of microscopy principles, methods, and theoretical foundations. Participants gained insights into image formation in fluorescence microscopes, resolution, and noise. This was followed by an introduction to superresolution microscopy techniques, including Single-Molecule localization Microscopy (STORM, PALM, DNA-PAINT) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM, ISM, Airyscan, SoRa). Zuzana Burdikova then guided attendees through the theoretical aspects of bioimage processing in Fiji, covering image formats, multi-dimensional image analysis, data visualization, and quantitative analysis. Practical sessions allowed participants to apply their knowledge, exploring two-channel colocalization, image filtering, and quantitative measurements in Fiji.

Day 2 (Wed, June 7):
The second day commenced with a remote presentation by SVI.nl, introducing participants to the Huygens deconvolution software used in widefield, confocal, and superresolution microscopy. Zdenek Svindrych demonstrated the practical applications of ThunderSTORM, an ImageJ plug-in for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data analysis and superresolution imaging. The session included an overview of the ThunderSTORM workflow, covering localization, filtering, rendering, and 3D STORM using the astigmatism method. Jakub Soukup explored advanced noise reduction algorithms such as Noise2Void and StarDist. Martin Sch&auml;tz discussed data management strategies.

In the afternoon, participants engaged in practical sessions. Martin Sch&auml;tz presented Ilastik, a versatile software for image classification and segmentation. Pat Robison delivered a scientific lecture on the role of detyrosinated microtubules in contracting cardiomyocytes. Zdenek Svindrych, along with other experts, led a hands-on session on customizing Fiji using the ImageJ Macro language. The day concluded with a practical session on the interactive design of GPU-accelerated image data flow graphs in Fiji, guided by Martin Sch&auml;tz and the workshop team.

Diese FAQ versammeln Fragen, die uns h&auml;ufig im Zusammenhang mit k&uuml;nstlicher Intelligenz (KI) und guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis (GWP) erreichen. Die Antworten sollen bei der Orientierung in einem schnelllebigen Thema helfen, ohne dabei pr&auml;skriptiv zu sein. Sie stellen keine offizielle Positionierung des Ombudsman f&uuml;r die Wissenschaft (OfdW) dar, sondern beschreiben den Status Quo und ordnen bereits bestehende Empfehlungen aus Sicht der GWP ein, identifizieren L&uuml;cken und verweisen auf weiterf&uuml;hrende Literatur. Diese FAQ-Sammlung richtet sich prim&auml;r an Forschende. F&uuml;r die Nutzung von KI in der Lehre und in studentischen (Qualifikations-)Arbeiten sind i.d.R. universit&auml;re KI-Richtlinien, angepasste Pr&uuml;fungsordnungen und Selbstst&auml;ndigkeitserkl&auml;rungen sowie Entscheidungen individueller Lehrpersonen ma&szlig;geblich. Daher werden eventuelle Besonderheiten von KI in der Lehre und in Pr&uuml;fungsangelegenheiten in diesen FAQ nicht besprochen.
