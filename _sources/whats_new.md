Today, research data is often stored in many different places, difficult to find and only available for a limited time. Base4NFDI creates the basis for better findability, accessibility, interoperability ans reusability of research data. For this purpose, common, technical services are developed together with experts for the data in the different research disciplines. Since many scientific fields have similar requirements for research data, Base4NFDI supports common solutions to avoid parallel developments. Already existing services are thereby adapted or extended to be usable for researchers from other disciplines.
This slides were presented from Sonja Schimmler at the first Conference on Research Data Infrastructure (CoRDI 2023) on September 14, 2023 in Karlsruhe, Germany. The presentation will give an insight into the idea and structure of Base4NFDI, the processes for developing basic services and the services currently funded.

When training people in topics such as programming, bio-image analysis or data science, it makes sense to define a training strategy with a wider perspective than just trainees needs. This slide deck gives insights into aspects to consider when defining a training strategy. It considers funder's interests, financial aspects, metrics / goals, steps towards sustainability and opportunities for outreach and for founding future collaborations.

## Introducing OMERO-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data

omero-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data viewing.
OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.
The three files in this Zenodo Record are all the same poster saved in different format all with high resolution images.

Acquired with an Nikon SIM, in 2D-SIM mode at 488nm of excitation with 30% laser power and 200ms of exposition.&nbsp; Fluorescence is a knocked-in mStayGold-&beta;2Spectrin. Cells are rat hippocampal neurons &agrave; DIV 3. The file is a reconstructed multiposition acquisition (10 positions). Uploaded to show a probable issue with Bio-Formats in Fiji, where SIM reconstrcuted multipositions files open like static noise.&nbsp;
