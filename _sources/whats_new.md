This White Paper outlines a strategic approach to further develop the collaboration among Research Infrastructures (RIs) in the European Union (EU) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC, for its acronym in Spanish/Portuguese), prioritising long-term planning and commitment, sustainability, open access, and scientific excellence. Building upon existing policy frameworks, particularly the EU-CELAC Working Group on Research Infrastructures, this document proposes concrete mechanisms to strengthen bi-regional cooperation in research and innovation, in the context of shared values and global scientific needs.
Research Infrastructures (RIs) are key enablers of scientific progress and innovation, especially in advanced domains such as artificial intelligence, big data, and biomedicine. Their value lies not only in the high performance of their sophisticated equipment, but also in the advanced expertise of RI researchers and technical staff. Global challenges&mdash;like pandemics, climate change, and energy transition&mdash;require robust and internationally connected RIs supported by stable, long-term institutional commitments.
This White Paper focuses on strengthening RI collaboration between European and CELAC countries, particularly in Bioimaging and Structural Biology, which already have established network partnerships through Euro-BioImaging ERIC / Latin America BioImaging, and Instruct-ERIC / Mercosur Structural Biology Center. The document serves as a roadmap for expanding EU&ndash;CELAC cooperation, building upon previous collaborative projects, and proposing new mechanisms for sustainable engagement.

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



MetaFold simplifies laboratory data management through easy-to-use templates that create reproducible metadata.It reduces manual steps by automatically generating folder structures and metadata files at multiple locations simultaneously.Thanks to its integration with OMERO and ELNs, microscopy data can be automatically imported based on the existing metadata &mdash; saving researchers significant time and effort.
Core functions


Template-based creation of project folders and metadata forms


Multi-user and group-level configuration


Secure credential storage and user authentication


Direct integrations with elabFTW (ELN) and OMERO (image data management)


Project discovery: recursive scan and visualization of existing data


Category system: customizable templates by project type
