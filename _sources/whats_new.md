The software tool is developed on demand of Radiological Department of Faculty Hospital of Kr&aacute;lovsk&eacute; Vinohrady, with the aim to provide a tool to estimate the percentage of pneumonia (or COVID-19 presence) in lungs. Paper&nbsp;Estimation of Covid-19 lungs damage based on computer tomography images analysis presenting the tool is available on F1000reserach&nbsp;DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.109020.1. The underlying dataset is published in Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939).&nbsp;One of the challenges was to design a tool that would be available without complicated install procedures and would process data in a reasonable time even on office computers. For this reason, 8-bit and 16-bit version of the tool exists. The FIJI software (or ImageJ with Bio-Formats plugin installed) was selected as the best candidate. Examples of use and tutorials are available at GitHub.&nbsp;
The third version includes an intra-variabilty analysis, containing evaluation both for percentage and score metrics.
Underlying data:DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939The first five datasets are analyzed using this tool, with results and parameters to repeat the analysis in results_csv.csv or results.xlsx.

The work was funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports by grant &lsquo;Development of Advanced Computational Algorithms for evaluating post-surgery rehabilitation&rsquo; number LTAIN19007. The work was also supported from the grant of Specific university research &ndash; grant No FCHI 2022-001.

EVOLVE Mentoring Masterclasses
Description:This series captures the class guides of the 2025 masterclasses from Euro‑BioImaging's EVOLVE Mentoring Program.
Included Masterclasses:

Peter O&rsquo;Toole &ndash; &ldquo;Entrepreneurship &amp; Leadership in Imaging Core Facilities&rdquo;&nbsp;Peter O&rsquo;Toole, President of the Royal Microscopical Society and Director of the Bioscience Technology Facility (University of York), kicks off the series with a deep dive into entrepreneurial leadership. He highlights how to balance science, business, and technology, emphasizing stakeholder engagement, staff investment, cross-training, and using social media to boost visibility and unlock funding.
Ilaria Testa &ndash; &ldquo;Interdisciplinary Science, SMART Microscopy &amp; Team Building&rdquo;&nbsp;Professor Ilaria Testa (SciLifeLab &amp; KTH) reflects on her transition from physics to super-resolution microscopy and team leadership. Her session underscores the power of crossing disciplinary boundaries, mentorship, and innovation in live-cell imaging .
Daphna Link‑Sourani &ndash; &ldquo;Leadership, Facility Management &amp; Work‑Life Balance&rdquo;&nbsp;Dr. Daphna Link‑Sourani (Technion Human MRI Research Center) challenges hierarchical notions of leadership, advocating instead for integrity, empathy, and strategic vision. She draws on her experience establishing an MRI facility to discuss crisis management, user engagement, and balancing career demands.
Muriel Mari &ndash; &ldquo;Women in Science: Normalizing, Supporting &amp; Leading"&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Muriel Mari (Aarhus University) leads a powerful reflection on gender equity in science. Her masterclass goes beyond barriers&mdash;focusing on cultural shifts, inclusive leadership, and redefining success. She encourages institutions and individuals alike to move from tokenism to transformative support, and to recognize the diverse paths women take in STEM.
Sylvia E. Le D&eacute;v&eacute;dec &ndash; &ldquo;Image Data Management &amp; FAIR Core Facilities&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Sylvia Le D&eacute;v&eacute;dec (Leiden University) discusses how to integrate FAIR data principles in imaging core facilities. Drawing on her experience with high-content imaging and Open Science advocacy, she outlines actionable steps toward sustainable, reusable, and accessible data workflows.

Why Archive These Sessions?These masterclasses offer invaluable insights for core facility managers, imaging scientists, and team leaders in life sciences. They blend hands-on leadership strategies, technical facility growth advice, and real-world experience&mdash;making them essential viewing for professionals and institutions aiming to build sustainable, people-centred imaging infrastructures.

## Vision Language Models for Bio-image Data Science

Robert Haase

Published 2025-06-25

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



In this talk, I demonstrate potential use-cases for vision-language models (VLM) in bio-image data science, focusing on how to analyse microscopy image data. It covers these use-cases:

cell counting
bounding-box segmentation
image descriptions
VLMs guessing which algorithm to use for processing
Data analysis code generation
Answering github issues&nbsp;

The talk also points at a number of VLM-based open-source tools which start reshaping the scientific bio-image data science domain:

bia-bob
unprompted
git-bob
napari-chatgpt
bioimage.io chatbot
