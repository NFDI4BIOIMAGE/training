Licensed CC-BY-4.0



MetaFold simplifies laboratory data management through easy-to-use templates that create reproducible metadata.It reduces manual steps by automatically generating folder structures and metadata files at multiple locations simultaneously.Thanks to its integration with OMERO and ELNs, microscopy data can be automatically imported based on the existing metadata &mdash; saving researchers significant time and effort.
Core functions


Template-based creation of project folders and metadata forms


Multi-user and group-level configuration


Secure credential storage and user authentication


Direct integrations with elabFTW (ELN) and OMERO (image data management)


Project discovery: recursive scan and visualization of existing data


Category system: customizable templates by project type
