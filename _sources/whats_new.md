## Develop an LLM-based framework for translating KNIME workflows into Galaxy Imaging workflows

KNIME and Galaxy are leading workflow platforms widely used for imaging, data analysis, and automation. However, differences in their architectures make translating imaging workflows between them difficult and time- consuming. The lack of automated conversion workflow reuse. Enabling automatic conversion of KNIME imaging workflows into Galaxy could enhance accessibility, streamline image analysis with further Open Source Tools (i.e. OMERO, INTOB), and accelerate imaging-based scientific discovery. Our goal is to develop generative AI strategies for automated KNIME-to- Galaxy workflow translation using large language models (LLM). By learning from test workflows, the system will adapt to platform changes and improve accuracy over time.

Galaxy is an online computational platform used by a global community of thousands of scientists for processing of large-scale data.This collective effort includes the development of the Galaxy software framework, the integration of analysis tools and visualizations, and the operation of public servers that provide access to Galaxy through web browsers (usegalaxy.eu). Galaxy increases the FAIRness of data analysis pipelines by&nbsp; providing versioned tools and workflows that can be annotated, shared and published. Furthermore, Galaxy has a dedicated interface for image data analysis&mdash;imaging.usegalaxy.eu&mdash;providing a comprehensive suite of tools and workflows tailored specifically for imaging scientists. Through the implementation of open source CellProfiler tool into the Galaxy framework, we are creating an interactive evaluation environment for the Cell Painting community. This environment can aid the drug discovery process.

Abstract:
European Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS-RIs), one of the five major RI Science Clusters in Europe, were established to provide access to cutting-edge technologies to the scientific community. Individually, and collectively as the LS-RI cluster, they contribute to the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), under the aegis of the EOSC Federation. They are actively involved in the design and implementation of Competence Centres (CCs). These aim to increase the accessibility of domain-specific knowledge and tools, enhance interoperability, facilitate sharing and harmonisation of procedures, and promote Open Science and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices. In this paper, we report a landscape mapping of the existing resources that formed the basis for the construction of CCs. We describe the possible design of CCs and their articulation with the LS-RIs. We focus on community-based ideas and recommendations to increase the potential of CCs to address long-standing challenges in sustainability, governance, scalability, and interoperability of Open Science within EOSC and the European Research Area (ERA) more generally.This paper provides a description of the nascent LS CCs, built following a survey of needs and services of existing LS-RI communities. When fully implemented, the LS CCs will serve as dynamic hubs to foster innovation, contribute to the EOSC&rsquo;s future FAIR web of data, and support ongoing developments of the EOSC Federation. They will act as drivers of collaborative and impactful LS research in Europe and beyond. We explore the underlying challenges, and propose solutions, to ensure that the establishment of CCs will add value to the LS RI community, and to the EOSC, in a sustainable way.
