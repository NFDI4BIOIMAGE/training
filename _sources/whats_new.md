OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.

The software tool is developed on demand of Radiological Department of Faculty Hospital of Kr&aacute;lovsk&eacute; Vinohrady, with the aim to provide a tool to estimate the percentage of pneumonia (or COVID-19 presence) in lungs. Paper&nbsp;Estimation of Covid-19 lungs damage based on computer tomography images analysis presenting the tool is available on F1000reserach&nbsp;DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.109020.1. The underlying dataset is published in Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939).&nbsp;One of the challenges was to design a tool that would be available without complicated install procedures and would process data in a reasonable time even on office computers. For this reason, 8-bit and 16-bit version of the tool exists. The FIJI software (or ImageJ with Bio-Formats plugin installed) was selected as the best candidate. Examples of use and tutorials are available at GitHub.&nbsp;
The third version includes an intra-variabilty analysis, containing evaluation both for percentage and score metrics.
Underlying data:DOI:10.5281/zenodo.5805939The first five datasets are analyzed using this tool, with results and parameters to repeat the analysis in results_csv.csv or results.xlsx.

## [ELMI2025] The Road to OME-Zarr 1.0

Josh Moore

Published 2025-06-05

Licensed CC-BY-4.0



Presented at https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/elmi2025/
&nbsp;
Abstract
For over 20 years, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) has developed tools and specifications to support bioimaging data sharing. Technologies such as Bio-Formats, OMERO, and OME-TIFF have helped researchers manage the growing size, complexity, and acquisition rates of imaging datasets. However, with increasing mandates for research data management, such as the Nelson memo in the United States, and the shift toward cloud-native workflows, the bioimaging community faces new challenges in ensuring scalable and FAIR data infrastructure.
In 2024, following expanding community engagement, the focus of the Next-Generation File Format (NGFF) community was on building consensus around a Request for Comments (RFC) process. This collaborative effort has laid the foundation for future refinements and wider adoption. In parallel, we hosted the &ldquo;OME2024 NGFF Challenge," bringing together over the course of just four months hundreds of terabytes of data in a first prototype of federated image hosting, showcasing the power of OME-Zarr for handling large-scale, distributed datasets.
In 2025, we are set to take a major step toward a stable FAIR solution with OME-Zarr 1.0. This milestone marks a crucial phase towards an international standard, providing an open, cloud-optimized, and scalable solution for handling terabyte- and petabyte-scale imaging data. The 1.0 release will introduce long-awaited transforms, enabling robust support for multimodal datasets, followed by collections and an extensibility mechanism to accommodate evolving scientific needs. These additions emphasize a solid foundation on which future capabilities can be built while providing the stability needed for broader adoption of the format. This presentation will outline the path to 1.0, including community-driven refinements, vendor engagement to ensure complete metadata representation, and alignment with global bioimaging initiatives. As imaging data continues to grow in scale and complexity, consensus-driven evolution of infrastructure will be key to ensuring a truly FAIR future for bioimaging.

Abstract
FAIR 101 - Navigating FAIR data from principles to practice
Isabel Kemmer, Euro-BioImaging ERIC
This workshop will introduce the FAIR principles in the context of bioimaging data. Designed for researchers working across scales and technologies of biological and biomedical imaging, the session will address the unique challenges posed by complex, multidimensional bioimaging datasets. With the aim of providing simple yet impactful steps for a smooth start to the FAIR journey we will explore the features and benefits of FAIR data through interactive exercises and discussions - from metadata annotation and data management planning to repository selection. By the end of the workshop, you will feel more confident in applying the FAIR concepts and be prepared to improve your imaging workflows to make your precious data even more valuable.

Presentation slides from an EMBL-EBI Webinar Talk within the webinar series:
"How to organise and share my imaging data? - Multimodal data management for marine biologists, environmental scientists and imaging specialists"
&nbsp;
Abstract / Description
Bioimaging is a pervasive and indispensable methodological approach in the life and biomedical sciences. Due to the development of new technologies and the easier access to compute resources, bioimaging experiments have become a big data discipline, facing the same challenges as other omics technologies within the life sciences. However, to fully exploit the potential of bioimage data, it is necessary to make the data FAIR. In this webinar we will present viable solutions for storing, processing, analysing, and, first and foremost, sharing bioimaging data. We will introduce services provided to the scientific community, that are dealing with various aspects of the bioimage data life cycle such as:
- Where to get support for bioimage data management- Local bioimage data management: OMERO and beyond- Annotation of bioimage data: metadata, ontologies, REMBI etc- Linking your image data with experimental protocols and analysis results- Large data living in the cloud: ome.zarr- Publication of bioimage data
Who is this course for?
This webinar is suitable for marine biologists and environmental scientists collecting samples from the natural environment, generating, visualising, annotating and analysing large, multimodal datasets such as imaging data, and sharing their data by submitting them to public data repositories. The webinar will support you to set up an efficient data flow that is aligned with FAIR principles.
This event is part of a webinar series&nbsp;organised by the&nbsp;STANDFLOW&nbsp;project, an initiative supported by EMBL&rsquo;s&nbsp;Planetary biology Transversal Theme. STANDFLOW is about a collaborative effort towards creating a standardised data management workflow. The project primarily utilises imaging data derived from samples collected through the&nbsp;TREC&nbsp;(Traversing European Coastlines) and the&nbsp;Roscoff Culture Collection. For details on all topics covered in this series and registration information, please visit the following link:&nbsp;How to organise and share my imaging data?: Multimodal data management for marine biologists, and environmental scientists and imaging specialists
Outcomes
By the end of the webinar you will be able to:&nbsp;

Find resources and support for bioimage data management
Get started with bioimage data annotation
Identify the dos and don'ts for bioimage data publication
