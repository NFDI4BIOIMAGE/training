The topics cover many aspects of research data management, such as data management plans and the publication of research data, as well as didactic units on learning concepts, workshop design and a range of didactic methods.

After the end of the project, the concept was supplemented and updated by members of the Sub-Working Group Training/Further Education (UAG Schulungen/Fortbildungen) of the DINI/nestor Working Group Research Data (DINI/nestor-AG Forschungsdaten). The newly published English version of the Train-the-Trainer Concept contains the translated concept, the materials and all methods of the Train-the-Trainer Programme.

Efficiently starting institutional research data management,proficient,Research Data Management,https://zenodo.org/record/3490058 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3490058,CC-BY-4.0,"Researchers are increasingly often confronted with research data management (RDM) topics during their work. Higher education institutions therefore begin to offer services for RDM at some point to give support and advice. However, many groundbreaking decisions have to be made at the very beginning of RDM services. Priorities must be set and policies formulated. Likewise, the staff must first be qualified in order to provide advice and adequately deal with the manifold problems awaiting.
The FDMentor project has therefore bundled the expertise of five German universities with different experiences and levels of RDM knowledge to jointly develop strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and open access training material. Humboldt-Universit&auml;t zu Berlin, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin, University of Potsdam, and European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) have worked together on common solutions that are easy to adapt. With funding of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the collaborative project addressed four problem areas: strategy development, legal issues, policy development, and competence enhancement. The aim of the project outcomes is to provide other higher education institutions with the best possible support for the efficient introduction of research data management. Therefore, all project results are freely accessible under the CC-BY 4.0 international license. The early involvement of the community in the form of workshops and the collection of feedback has proven its worth: the FDMentor strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and training materials are applied and adapted beyond the partner universities.",2019-10-15,Text,text,"Biernacka, Katarzyna * Cortez, Katrin * Helbig, Kerstin",,,en

OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO.

These slides introduce current challenges and potential solutions for openly sharing training materials, focusing on bio-image analysis. In this field a lot of training materials circulate in private channels, but openly shared, reusable materials, according to the FAIR-principles, are still rare. Using the CC-BY license and publicly acessible repositories are proposed to fill this gap.

Internal and external experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;
Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.

The fundamental tool, the microscope, has enabled seminal discoveries like that of the cell as the smallest unit of life, and continues to expand our understanding of biological processes. Today, we can follow the interaction of single molecules within nanoseconds in a living cell, and the development of complete small organisms like fish and flies over several days starting from the fertilized egg. Each image pixel encodes multiple spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions, compounding the massive volume and complexity of bioimage data. Proper handling of this data is indispensable for analysis and its lack has become a growing hindrance for the many disciplines of the life and biomedical sciences relying on bioimaging. No single domain has the expertise to tackle this bottleneck alone.
As a method-specific consortium, NFDI4BIOMAGE seeks to address these issues, enabling bioimaging data to be shared and re-used like they are acquired, i.e., independently of disciplinary boundaries. We will provide solutions for exploiting the full information content of bioimage data and enable new discoveries through sharing and re-analysis. Our RDM strategy is based on a robust needs analysis that derives not only from a community survey but also from over a decade of experience in German BioImaging, the German Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis. It considers the entire lifecycle of bioimaging data, from acquisition to archiving, including analysis and enabling re-use. A foundational element of this strategy is the definition of a common, cloud-compatible, and interoperable digital object that bundles binary images with their descriptive and provenance metadata. With members from plant biology to neuroscience, NFDI4BIOIMAGE will champion the standardization of bioimage data to create a framework that answers discipline-specific needs while ensuring communication and interoperability with data types and RDM systems across domains. Integration of bioimage data with, e.g., omics data as the basis for spatial omics, holds great promise for fields such as cancer medicine. Unlocking the full potential of bioimage data will rely on the development and broad availability of exceptional analysis tools and training sets. NFDI4BIOIMAGE will make these accessible and usable including cutting-edge AI-based methods in scalable cloud environments. NFDI4BIOIMAGE intersects with multiple NFDI consortia, most prominently with GHGA for linking image and genomics data and with DataPLANT on the definition of FAIR data objects. Last but not least, NFDI4BIOIMAGE is internationally well connected and represents the opportunity for German scientists to keep path with and have a voice in several international initiatives focusing on the FAIRification of bioimage data as one of the main challenges for the advancement of knowledge in the life and biomedical sciences.",2024-08-07,,,"Consortium, NFDI4BIOIMAGE",,pdf,en

Such a platform thrives on the participation of users who want to search, create, manage or use teaching and learning materials.
A schematization of the metadata is necessary for the interoperability of teaching and learning materials. This is done by the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF), which provides a framework for making the metadata of teaching and learning materials transparent, comparable and smooth to integrate into the DALIA platform. It includes the description and explanation of the data fields for the online publication of educational resources.
The DIF was developed in close consultation with the scientific community. This development process included several feedback rounds in which valuable feedback was provided and subsequently incorporated into the DIF. This not only contributed to the clear, transparent and user-oriented definitions of the data fields, and to a clear structure, but also to the integration of many existing data standards and to the (special) requirements of the scientific community. The selection of elements is based on the&nbsp;Dublin Core Application Profile.
The DIF is provided as a PDF document and in table form (ODS) to convey the attributes of the teaching and learning materials and their definitions in an easily understandable form and to facilitate communication. It also includes a legend and an example in tabular form. In addition, a template (CSV) with the attributes as column headers is provided, which can be used for recording the metadata of the teaching and learning materials. The tables can also be transferred to technical application profiles.

[Workshop] FAIR data handling for microscopy: Structured metadata annotation in OMERO,advanced beginner,,https://zenodo.org/records/11109616 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11109616,CC-BY-4.0,"Description
Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:

Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining
Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO

The target group for this workshop
This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Who are the trainers (see trainer description below for more details)

Building FAIR image analysis pipelines for high-content-screening (HCS) data using Galaxy,,,https://zenodo.org/records/14044640 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14044640 * https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-11-08-galaxy-imaging-fair-pipelines/,CC-BY-4.0,"Imaging is crucial across various scientific disciplines, particularly in life sciences, where it plays a key role in studies ranging from single molecules to whole organisms. However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data, especially from high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms, present significant challenges. Managing and analysing this data efficiently requires well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR principles&mdash;ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable across different domains.
In the frame of NFDI4BioImaging (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing, analysing, and sharing HCS data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to make findable and machine-readable metadata using (semi)automatic analysis pipelines. In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity, supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata.
Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis. By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases the efficiency of HCS bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific community's efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation.
In the present study, we proposed an automated analysis pipeline for storing, processing, analysing, and sharing HCS bioimaging data. The (semi)automatic workflow was developed by taking as a case study a dataset of zebrafish larvae and cell lines images previously obtained from an automated imaging system generating data in an HCS fashion. In our workflows, images are automatically enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to the UFZ-OME Remote Objects (OMERO) server using a novel OMERO tool suite developed with GALAXY. Workflows give the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and perform image analysis (i.e. annotation) or even more complex toxicological analyses (dose response modelling). Furthermore, we want to improve the FAIRness of the protocol by adding a direct upload link to the Image Data Resource (IDR) repository to automatically prepare the data for publication and sharing.",2024-11-06,,,"Massei, Riccardo * Berndt, Matthias * Serrano-Solano, Beatriz * Busch, Wibke * Scholz, Stefan * Bohring, Hannes * Nyffeler, Jo * Reger, Luise * Bumberger, Jan * Lopez-Delisle, Lucille",,odp,en

Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:

Next, the slide was unmounted and stained using the fully automated Ventana Discovery xT autostainer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). All steps were performed on automate with Ventana solutions. Sections were pretreated with heat using the CC1 solution under mild conditions. The primary rat anti BrDU (clone: BU1/75 (ICR1), Serotec, diluted 1:300) was incubated 1 hour at 37&deg;C. After incubation with a donkey anti rat biotin diluted 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), chromogenic revelation was performed with DabMap kit. The section was counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (J.T. Baker) before a second round of imaging on DM5500 PL Fluotar 40X N.A.1.0 oil (color camera: DFC 320 R2, pixel dimension: 0.1725 microns). Before acquisition, a white-balance as well as a shading correction is performed according to Leica LAS software wizard. The fluorescence and DAB images were converted in ome.tiff multiresolution file with the kheops Fiji Plugin.

Institutionalization and Collaboration as a Way of Addressing the Challenges Open Science Presents to Libraries: The University of Konstanz as a National Pioneer,,,https://zenodo.org/records/12699637 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12699637,CC-BY-4.0,"The rise of Open Science (OS) and the academic community&rsquo;s needs that come with it bring about a range of challenges for academic libraries. To face these challenges, the University of Konstanz has created a competence unit called&nbsp;Team Open Science&nbsp;in the Communication, Information, Media Center (KIM) - a joint unit of library and IT infrastructure. The Team creates synergies within itself and across the library. In December 2023, it involved 12 staff members specialising in open access (OA), research data management (RDM), open educational resources (OER) and virtual research environments (VRE). It collaborates closely with other KIM departments. This submission shall serve as a best practice example for the impact of OS on research libraries and, beyond that, the impact of research libraries on universities.
To enhance and foster OS, the Team provides individual consultations, services and office hours for researchers. Here, it collaborates closely with other librarians like subject specialists and the Team University Publications. Along similar lines, the KIM offers institutional repositories for publications (KOPS) and research data (KonDATA). Beyond that, the Team provides solutions to host OA journals and analyses researchers&rsquo; VRE needs to decide on implementation options. In sum, the Team is the central OS contact point for the entire university, underlining the major role the library holds in making institutional impact.
Furthermore, the Team had the leading role in creating the University of Konstanz&rsquo; OS Policy, one of the first ones passed by a German university. This policy stands out because it encompasses various OS domains. It demands, among other things, that text publications be made OA and that research data be managed according to relevant subject-specific standards. If permissible and reasonable, it demands that research data should be made publicly available at the earliest possible time. Along these lines, the policy has a large impact on how the library handles closed access books and subscription-based journals. As a consequence, OA is pursued wherever possible, leading to the highest OA quota of all German universities. In that sense, the Team is a crucial driving force of OS in the University of Konstanz, which ties in with the library&rsquo;s major role of open research transformation.
Beyond the University of Konstanz, the Team is involved in a range of national and international projects collaborating with other libraries. On a national level, they lead the project open.access-network which provides an information platform for researchers and librarians and connects the German-speaking OA community through events like bar camps. The project KOALA-AV supports libraries in establishing consortial solutions for financing Diamond OA publications. Moreover, the Team is involved in the federal state initiative for RDM in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg (bwFDM). Here, the Team is in charge of forschungsdaten.info, the German-speaking countries&rsquo; leading RDM information platform, which will be offered in English within the next years. Internationally, the Team cooperates with librarians and other OS professionals from the European Reform University Alliance (ERUA) and the European University for Well-Being (EUniWell), establishing formats for best practice exchange, such as monthly OS Meet-Ups.",2024-07-09,,,"Habinger, Sophie * Heber, Maximilian * Kralj, Sonja * Mikautsch, Emilia",,pdf,en

[Workshop] Bioimage data management and analysis with OMERO,advanced beginner,nfdi4bioimage * research data management,https://zenodo.org/records/11350689 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11350689,CC-BY-4.0,"Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024, at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)
Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.
Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation
Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji
Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks
Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with OMERO
The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their everyday practice.
Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection to their institutional networks to access OMERO

Abstract:

Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects. To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats, data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.

In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification. German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities, research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice. &nbsp;",2023-05-03,,,"Weidtkamp-Peters, Stefanie * Hanne, Janina * Schmidt, Christian",,pdf * pptx,en

Key-Value pair template for annotation in OMERO for light microscopy data acquired with AxioScan7 - Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI),,nfdi4bioimage * research data management,https://zenodo.org/records/12578084 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12578084,CC-BY-4.0,"This Key-Value pair template is used for the data documentation during imaging experiments and the later data annotation in OMERO. It is tailored for the usage and image acquisition at the slide scanning system Zeiss AxioScan 7 in the Core Facility Cellular Imaging (CFCI). It contains important metadata of the imaging experiment, which are not saved in the corresponding imaging files. All users of the Core Facility Cellular Imaging are trained to use that file to document their imaging parameters directly during the data acquisition with the possibility for a later upload to OMERO. Furthermore, there is a corresponding public example image used in the publication ""Setting up an institutional OMERO environment for bioimage data: perspectives from both facility staff and users"" and is available here:
https://omero.med.tu-dresden.de/webclient/?show=image-33248
This template was developed by the CFCI staff during the setup and usage of the AxioScan 7 and is based on the REMBI recommendations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606015).
With this template it is possible to create a csv-file, that can be used to annotate an image or dataset in OMERO using the annotation script (https://github.com/ome/omero-scripts/blob/develop/omero/annotation_scripts/).
How to use:

fill the template sheet&nbsp; with your metadata
select and copy the data range containing the Keys and Values
open a new excel sheet and paste transpose in cell A1&nbsp;
Important: cell A1 contains always the name 'dataset' and cell A2 contains the exact name of the image/dataset, which should be annotated in OMERO
save the new excel sheet in csv-file (comma separated values) format

An example can be seen in sheet 3 'csv_AxioScan'.
Important note: The code has to be 8-Bit UCS transformation format (UTF-8) otherwise several characters (for example &micro;, %,&deg;) might be not able to decode by the annotation script. We encountered this issue with old Microsoft-Office versions (MS Office 2016).&nbsp;
Note: By filling the values in the excel sheet, avoid the usage of comma as decimal delimiter.

Also, it is desirable that all stakeholders of a project understand all parts of the experiment and analysis to draw and support the right conclusions. For imaging experiments this usually requires a basic understanding of the underlying physics. This has not necessarily been part of the professional training of all stakeholders, e.g. biologists or data scientists. Therefore an affordable platform for easily demonstrating and explaining imaging principles would be desirable.
Building up on a commercially available STEM Optics kit we developed extensions with widely available and affordable components to demonstrate advanced imaging techniques like e.g. confocal, lightsheet, OPT, spectral imaging. All models are quick and easy to build, yet demonstrate the important physical principles each imaging technique is based on.
Further use cases for this kit are training courses, demonstrations for imaging newbies when designing an experiment and outreach activities but also basic level prototyping.",2023-10-05,,,"Utz, Nadine * Reither, Sabine * Hans, Ruth * Feldhaus, Christian",,pdf,en

Here, we present key findings, procedures, effective measures and recommendations for generating and establishing sustainable LS resources based on the collaborative, cross-disciplinary work done within the EOSC-Life (European Open Science Cloud for Life Sciences) consortium. Bringing together 13 European LS Research Infrastructures (RIs), it has laid the foundation for an open, digital space to support biological and medical research. Using lessons learned from 27 selected projects, we describe the organisational, technical, financial and legal/ethical challenges that represent the main barriers to sustainability in the life sciences. We show how EOSC-Life provides a model for sustainable FAIR data management, including solutions for sensitive- and industry-related resources, by means of cross-disciplinary training and best practices sharing. Finally, we illustrate how data harmonisation and collaborative work facilitate interoperability of tools, data, solutions and lead to a better understanding of concepts, semantics and functionalities in the life sciences.IN PRESS EMBO Journal:&nbsp;https://www.embopress.org/journal/14602075&nbsp;AVAILABLE SOON at : https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2023115008&nbsp;",2023-09-12,,,"David, Romain * Rybina, Arina * Burel, Jean-Marie * Heriche, Jean-Karim * Audergon, Pauline * Boiten, Jan-Willem * Coppens, Frederik * Crockett, Sara * Katrina, Exter * Fahrener, Sven * Fratelli, Maddalena * Goble, Carole * Gormanns, Philipp * Grantner, Tobias * Gruning, Bjorn * Gurwitz, KimTamara * Hancock, John * Harmse, Henriette * Holub, Petr * Juty, Nick * Karnbach, Geoffrey * Karoune, Emma * Keppler, Antje * Klemeier, Jessica * Lancelotti, Carla * Legras, Jean-Luc * Lister, L.Allyson * Longo, DarioLivio * Ludwig, Rebecca * Madon, Benedicte * Massimi, Marzia * Matser, Vera * Matteoni, Rafaele * Th., MayrhoferMichaela * Ohmann, Christian * Panagiotopoulou, Maria * Parkinson, Helen * Perseil, Isabelle * Pfander, Claudia * Pieruschka, Roland * Raess, Michael * Rauber, Andreas * Richard, AudreyS. * Romano, Paolo * Rosato, Antonio * Sanchez-Pla, Alex * Sansone, Susanna-Assunta * Sarkans, Ugis * Serrano-Solano, Beatriz * Tang, Jing * Tanoli, Ziaurrehman * Tedds, Jonathan * Wagener, Harald * Weise, Martin * Westerhoff, HansV. * Wittner, Rudolf * Ewbank, Jonathan * Blomberg, Niklas * Gribbon, Philip",,pdf,en

Data:
All the images were collected from 4 different research labs and a public database (SPARC database) to account for variations in image acquisition, sample preparation and immunolabelling.
For enteric neurons&nbsp;the pan-neuronal marker, Hu&nbsp;has been used and the&nbsp; 2D wholemounts images from mouse, rat and human tissue.
For enteric neuronal subtypes, 2D images for nNOS, MOR, DOR, ChAT, Calretinin, Calbindin, Neurofilament, CGRP and SST from mouse tissue have been used..
25 images were used&nbsp;from the following entries in the&nbsp;SPARC database:

Human tissue images were acquired using:&nbsp;


IX71 Olympus microscope (10X HC PL APO NA 0.3)&nbsp;


For more information, visit the&nbsp;Documentation website.
NOTE: The images for enteric neurons and neuronal subtypes have been rescaled to 0.568 &micro;m/pixel for mouse and rat. For human neurons, it has been rescaled to 0.9 &micro;m/pixel . This is to ensure the neuronal cell bodies have similar pixel area across images. The area of cells in pixels can vary based on resolution of image, magnification of objective used, animal species (larger animals -&gt; larger neurons) and potentially how the tissue is stretched during wholemount preparation&nbsp;
Average neuron area for neuronal model:&nbsp;701.2 &plusmn; 195.9 pixel2 (Mean &plusmn; SD, 6267 cells)
Average neuron area for neuronal subtype model:&nbsp;880.9 &plusmn; 316 pixel2 (Mean &plusmn; SD, 924 cells)

Optimisation and Validation of a Swarm Intelligence based Segmentation Algorithm for low Contrast Positron Emission Tomography,,,https://zenodo.org/records/7209862 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7209862,CC-BY-4.0,"In the field of radiooncological research, individualised therapy is one of the hot topics at the moment. As a key aspect biologically-adapted therapy is discussed. Therapy adaption based on biological parameters&nbsp;may include tomographic imaging to determine biological properties of the tumour. One often invoked&nbsp;imaging modality is positron emission tomography (PET) using the tracer [18F]-fluoromisonidazole&nbsp;(FMISO) for hypoxia imaging. Hypoxia imaging is of interest, because hypoxic tumours are known to be radiorestistant. Even further, patients with hypoxic tumours have worse prognosis compared to patients&nbsp;with normoxic tumours. Thus, hypoxia imaging appears promising for radiotherapy treatment adaption.&nbsp;For example, volumetric analysis of FMISO PET could deliver additional hypoxia target volumes, which&nbsp;may be irradiated with higher radiation doses to improve the therapeutic effect. However, limited contrast&nbsp;between target volume and background in FMISO PET images interferes image analysis.Established&nbsp;methods for target volume delineation in PET do not allow determination of reliable contours in FMISO PET. To tackle this aspect, this thesis focusses on an earlier developed swarm intelligence based&nbsp;segmentation algorithm for FMISO PET and rather, its optimisation and validation in a clinically relevant&nbsp;setting. In this setting, clinical FMISO PET images were used which were acquired as part of a clinical&nbsp;trial performed at the Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy and Radiooncology of the University&nbsp;Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. The segmentation algorithm was applied to these imaging data&nbsp;sets and optimised using a cross-validation approach incorporating reference contours from experienced&nbsp;observers who outlined FMISO PET positive volumes manually. Afterwards, the performance of the algorithm&nbsp;and the properties of the resulting contours were studied in more detail. The algorithm was shown&nbsp;to deliver contours which were similar to manually-created contours to a degree like manually-created&nbsp;contours were similar to each other. Thus, the application of the algorithm in clinical research is recommended&nbsp;to eliminate inter-observer-variabilities. Finally, it was shown that repeated FMISO PET imaging&nbsp;before and shortly after the beginning of combined radiochemotherapy lead to manually-created contours&nbsp;with significantly higher variations than the variations of automatically-created contours using the&nbsp;proposed algorithm. Increased contour similarity in subsequently acquired imaging data highlights the&nbsp;observer-independence of the algorithm. While several observers outline different volumes, in identical&nbsp;data sets as well as in subsequent imaging data sets, the algorithm outlines more stable volumes in both&nbsp;cases. Thus, increased contour reproducibility is reached by automation of the delineation process by&nbsp;the proposed algorithm.&nbsp;",2014-04-01,,,"Haase, Robert",,pdf,en

Training :&nbsp;Training was performed using the jupyter notebook 1-Training_notebook.ipynb.
Three different trainings (with the same random seed, same anisotropy, patch size and grid) were performed and produced three different models (./models/)

Validation images (from the random seed used) were exported to ease the visual inspection of the results(./val_rdm42/).

Validation:&nbsp;&nbsp;To save metrics in a csv file and compare predictions to the annotations the jupyter notebook 2-QC_notebook.ipynb can be used on the validation folder.

Large images: To test the model on larger images one can use Whole_ds441.tif (or Crop_ds441.tif )
These images were obtained using the plugin BigSticher on the raw data ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6646128 ), resaved as h5 and exported the downsample&nbsp;by 4 version.

Terminology service for research data management and knowledge discovery in low-temperature plasma physics,,,https://zenodo.org/records/14381522 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14381522, CC-BY-4.0,"Abstract: 
Terminology services (TS) [1,2] play a pivotal role in achieving structured metadata by providing controlled vocabularies and ontologies that standardize the description of data. This is a crucial aspect of research data management (RDM) in all scientific disciplines. In addition, TS facilitate the use of a common vocabulary within a scientific community also in a more general context, e.g. to annotate scientific papers, patents or other content for better discoverability, as envisaged by the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) [3] or the Patents4Science project [4].&nbsp;
To make use of these opportunities, terminologies, ontologies and knowledge graphs must be developed and made available as TS where they do not yet exist. This step is currently being taken by the research community in low-temperature plasma (LTP) physics. LTP physics explores partially ionized gases and its technological applications. This vibrant field offers innovative solutions for societal challenges, ranging from developing efficient lighting and solar cells to revolutionizing healthcare through plasma medicine. Various activities and projects have been started in the past years to support the RDM in LTP research and development and to facilitate the application of data-driven research methods. These activities are supported in parts by the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consortium, active work in the NFDI section &ldquo;(Meta)data, Terminologies, Provenance&rdquo;, and the basic service Terminology Services 4 NFDI (TS4NFDI) funded by Base4NFDI.&nbsp;
Recently, the ontology Plasma-O [5&ndash;7] for LTP physics has been developed at INP in collaboration with FIZ Karlsruhe &ndash; Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure, providing a framework for structuring metadata and building a knowledge graph for scientific information within the field. The present contribution will show how a TS utilizing this resource can support different aspects of RDM and knowledge discovery using concrete examples. The application cases include (i) standardizing data annotation: By providing researchers with a controlled vocabulary of LTP-specific terms and their relationships, ensuring consistent and unambiguous data descriptions; (ii) enabling semantic search: Moving beyond keyword-based searches, TS allow for complex queries based on the relationships between concepts, significantly improving data discoverability; (iii) facilitating data integration: By mapping data from different sources to a common ontology, TS enable seamless integration and analysis of heterogeneous datasets, which is crucial for data-driven research and development. The TS Suite of TS4NFDI with the provided widgets [8] fits perfectly to the requirements of these three application cases and will support the harmonization of metadata in LTP physics. The implementation of a public TS is required to provide the domain-specific metadata in a standardized format and will be instrumental in unlocking the full potential of the TS widgets for RDM and knowledge discovery by LTP researchers. Furthermore, the results can provide insights to other domains on how to apply TS to their specific needs.

Helpdesks guide researchers through this complex landscape and provide reliable support about all questions regarding research data management, including support for technical services, best practices, requirements of funding organizations and legal topics. In NFDI, most consortia have already established or are planning to establish helpdesks to support their specific communities. On a local level, many institutions have set up RDM helpdesks that provide support for the researchers of their own institution. Additional RDM support services are offered by RDM federal state initiatives, by research data centers, by specialist libraries, by the EOSC, and by providers of RDM-relevant tools. Helpdesks cover a wide range of institutions, disciplines, topics, methodologies and target audiences. However, the individual helpdesks are not yet interconnected and therefore cannot complement one another in an efficient way: Given the wide and constantly increasing complexity of RDM, no single helpdesk can provide the expertise for all potential support requests. Therefore, we see great potential in combining the efforts and resources of the existing RDM helpdesks into an efficient and comprehensive national RDM support network in order to provide optimal and tailored RDM support to all researchers and research-related institutions in Germany and in an international context.",2024-11-04,,,"Engel, Judith * Helling, Patrick * Herrenbrück, Robert * MarinaLemaire * Mehrtens, Hela * Schmidt, Marcus * Stellmacher, Martha * Weimer, Lukas * Wiljes, Cord * Zinke, Wolf",,pdf,en

Introducing OMERO-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data,,,https://zenodo.org/records/14832855 * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14832855, CC-BY-4.0,"omero-vitessce: an OMERO.web plugin for multi-modal data viewing.
OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.
