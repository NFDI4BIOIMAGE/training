The topics cover many aspects of research data management, such as data management plans and the publication of research data, as well as didactic units on learning concepts, workshop design and a range of didactic methods.

After the end of the project, the concept was supplemented and updated by members of the Sub-Working Group Training/Further Education (UAG Schulungen/Fortbildungen) of the DINI/nestor Working Group Research Data (DINI/nestor-AG Forschungsdaten). The newly published English version of the Train-the-Trainer Concept contains the translated concept, the materials and all methods of the Train-the-Trainer Programme.

Katarzyna Biernacka * Katrin Cortez * Kerstin Helbig,CC-BY-4.0,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3490058,Efficiently starting institutional research data management,,"Researchers are increasingly often confronted with research data management (RDM) topics during their work. Higher education institutions therefore begin to offer services for RDM at some point to give support and advice. However, many groundbreaking decisions have to be made at the very beginning of RDM services. Priorities must be set and policies formulated. Likewise, the staff must first be qualified in order to provide advice and adequately deal with the manifold problems awaiting.
The FDMentor project has therefore bundled the expertise of five German universities with different experiences and levels of RDM knowledge to jointly develop strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and open access training material. Humboldt-Universit&auml;t zu Berlin, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin, University of Potsdam, and European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) have worked together on common solutions that are easy to adapt. With funding of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the collaborative project addressed four problem areas: strategy development, legal issues, policy development, and competence enhancement. The aim of the project outcomes is to provide other higher education institutions with the best possible support for the efficient introduction of research data management. Therefore, all project results are freely accessible under the CC-BY 4.0 international license. The early involvement of the community in the form of workshops and the collection of feedback has proven its worth: the FDMentor strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and training materials are applied and adapted beyond the partner universities.",Unknown,.pdf,Research Data Management * include in DALIA,en,Text,text,proficient,2019-10-15,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,ca9f9ec2-2ec6-421e-86b1-2b165a875d37

OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training, a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team, imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic) in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable, adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners in using OMERO.

Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions, data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.

"Consortium, NFDI4BIOIMAGE",CC-BY-4.0,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13168693,NFDI4BIOIMAGE - National Research Data Infrastructure for Microscopy and Bioimage Analysis,,"Bioimaging refers to a collection of methods to visualize the internal structures and mechanisms of living organisms. The fundamental tool, the microscope, has enabled seminal discoveries like that of the cell as the smallest unit of life, and continues to expand our understanding of biological processes. Today, we can follow the interaction of single molecules within nanoseconds in a living cell, and the development of complete small organisms like fish and flies over several days starting from the fertilized egg. Each image pixel encodes multiple spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions, compounding the massive volume and complexity of bioimage data. Proper handling of this data is indispensable for analysis and its lack has become a growing hindrance for the many disciplines of the life and biomedical sciences relying on bioimaging. No single domain has the expertise to tackle this bottleneck alone.
As a method-specific consortium, NFDI4BIOMAGE seeks to address these issues, enabling bioimaging data to be shared and re-used like they are acquired, i.e., independently of disciplinary boundaries. We will provide solutions for exploiting the full information content of bioimage data and enable new discoveries through sharing and re-analysis. Our RDM strategy is based on a robust needs analysis that derives not only from a community survey but also from over a decade of experience in German BioImaging, the German Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis. It considers the entire lifecycle of bioimaging data, from acquisition to archiving, including analysis and enabling re-use. A foundational element of this strategy is the definition of a common, cloud-compatible, and interoperable digital object that bundles binary images with their descriptive and provenance metadata. With members from plant biology to neuroscience, NFDI4BIOIMAGE will champion the standardization of bioimage data to create a framework that answers discipline-specific needs while ensuring communication and interoperability with data types and RDM systems across domains. Integration of bioimage data with, e.g., omics data as the basis for spatial omics, holds great promise for fields such as cancer medicine. Unlocking the full potential of bioimage data will rely on the development and broad availability of exceptional analysis tools and training sets. NFDI4BIOIMAGE will make these accessible and usable including cutting-edge AI-based methods in scalable cloud environments. NFDI4BIOIMAGE intersects with multiple NFDI consortia, most prominently with GHGA for linking image and genomics data and with DataPLANT on the definition of FAIR data objects. Last but not least, NFDI4BIOIMAGE is internationally well connected and represents the opportunity for German scientists to keep path with and have a voice in several international initiatives focusing on the FAIRification of bioimage data as one of the main challenges for the advancement of knowledge in the life and biomedical sciences.",Unknown,.pdf,include in DALIA,en,,,,2024-08-07,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,0bdd51f9-a13c-4410-a71d-de8401f057ef

Such a platform thrives on the participation of users who want to search, create, manage or use teaching and learning materials.
A schematization of the metadata is necessary for the interoperability of teaching and learning materials. This is done by the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF), which provides a framework for making the metadata of teaching and learning materials transparent, comparable and smooth to integrate into the DALIA platform. It includes the description and explanation of the data fields for the online publication of educational resources.
The DIF was developed in close consultation with the scientific community. This development process included several feedback rounds in which valuable feedback was provided and subsequently incorporated into the DIF. This not only contributed to the clear, transparent and user-oriented definitions of the data fields, and to a clear structure, but also to the integration of many existing data standards and to the (special) requirements of the scientific community. The selection of elements is based on the&nbsp;Dublin Core Application Profile.
The DIF is provided as a PDF document and in table form (ODS) to convey the attributes of the teaching and learning materials and their definitions in an easily understandable form and to facilitate communication. It also includes a legend and an example in tabular form. In addition, a template (CSV) with the attributes as column headers is provided, which can be used for recording the metadata of the teaching and learning materials. The tables can also be transferred to technical application profiles.

Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:

Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining

Description:
Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers. It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless, the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop, participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at their institution. The topics include:

Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment

Target audience:
This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging core facility at the same institution.
The trainers:

Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist, University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)

Time and place
The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location: Heidelberg, Germany
Workshop learning goals

Learn the steps to establish a local RDM environment fit for bioimaging data
Create a network of IT experts and bioimaging specialists for bioimage RDM across institutions
Establish a stakeholder process management for installing OMERO-based RDM
Learn from each other, leverage different expertise

Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable repository such as the Bioimage Archive.

Abstract:

Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects. To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats, data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.

In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification. German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities, research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice. &nbsp;",Unknown,.pdf * .pptx,nfdi4bioimage * research data management * include in DALIA,en,,,,2023-05-03,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,9ca97882-53a0-4326-8662-8c50192b652d

Also, it is desirable that all stakeholders of a project understand all parts of the experiment and analysis to draw and support the right conclusions. For imaging experiments this usually requires a basic understanding of the underlying physics. This has not necessarily been part of the professional training of all stakeholders, e.g. biologists or data scientists. Therefore an affordable platform for easily demonstrating and explaining imaging principles would be desirable.
Building up on a commercially available STEM Optics kit we developed extensions with widely available and affordable components to demonstrate advanced imaging techniques like e.g. confocal, lightsheet, OPT, spectral imaging. All models are quick and easy to build, yet demonstrate the important physical principles each imaging technique is based on.
Further use cases for this kit are training courses, demonstrations for imaging newbies when designing an experiment and outreach activities but also basic level prototyping.",Unknown,.pdf,include in DALIA,en,,,,2023-10-05,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,abbcc42a-ec38-4b18-9e30-2e15a81d481b

Kunis,,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6905931,Engineering a Software Environment for Research Data Management of Microscopy Image Data in a Core Facility,,"This thesis deals with concepts and solutions in the field of data management in everyday scientific life for image data from microscopy. The focus of the formulated requirements has so far been on published data, which represent only a small subset of the data generated in the scientific process. More and more, everyday research data are moving into the focus of the principles for the management of research data that were formulated early on (FAIR-principles). The adequate management of this mostly multimodal data is a real challenge in terms of its heterogeneity and scope. There is a lack of standardised and established workflows and also the software solutions available so far do not adequately reflect the special requirements of this area. However, the success of any data management process depends heavily on the degree of integration into the daily work routine. Data management must, as far as possible, fit seamlessly into this process. Microscopy data in the scientific process is embedded in pre-processing, which consists of preparatory laboratory work and the analytical evaluation of the microscopy data. In terms of volume, the image data often form the largest part of data generated within this entire research process. In this paper, we focus on concepts and techniques related to the handling and description of this image data and address the necessary basics. The aim is to improve the embedding of the existing data management solution for image data (OMERO) into the everyday scientific work. For this purpose, two independent software extensions for OMERO were implemented within the framework of this thesis: OpenLink and MDEmic. OpenLink simplifies the access to the data stored in the integrated repository in order to feed them into established workflows for further evaluations and enables not only the internal but also the external exchange of data without weakening the advantages of the data repository. The focus of the second implemented software solution, MDEmic, is on the capturing of relevant metadata for microscopy. Through the extended metadata collection, a corresponding linking of the multimodal data by means of a unique description and the corresponding semantic background is aimed at. The configurability of MDEmic is designed to address the currently very dynamic development of underlying concepts and formats. The main goal of MDEmic is to minimise the workload and to automate processes. This provides the scientist with a tool to handle this complex and extensive task of metadata acquisition for microscopic data in a simple way. With the help of the software, semantic and syntactic standardisation can take place without the scientist having to deal with the technical concepts. The generated metadata descriptions are automatically integrated into the image repository and, at the same time, can be transferred by the scientists into formats that are needed when publishing the data.",Unknown,.pdf,nfdi4bioimage * research data managementv * include in DALIA,en,,,,2022-05-30,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,4f173204-6c66-4dec-9d22-a66d274d22a8

Workshop Abstract:
Effective Research Data Management (RDM) requires collaboration between infrastructure providers, support units, and domain-specific experts across scientific disciplines. Microscopy, or bioimaging, is a widely used technology at universities and research institutions, generating large, multi-dimensional datasets. Scientists now routinely produce microscopy data using advanced imaging modalities, often through centrally-provided instruments maintained by core facilities.
Bioimaging data management presents unique challenges: files are often large (e.g., 15+ GB for whole slide images), come in various proprietary formats, and are accessed frequently for viewing as well as for complex image processing and analysis workflows. Collaboration between experimenters, clinicians, group leaders, core facility staff, and image analysts adds to the complexity, increasing the risk of data fragmentation and metadata loss.
The DFG-funded project I3D:bio and the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE, part of Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), are addressing these challenges by developing solutions and best practices for managing large, complex microscopy datasets. This workshop introduces the challenges of bioimaging RDM to institutional support personnel, including, for example, library staff, IT departments, and data stewards. Participants will explore the bioimaging RDM system OMERO, and apply structured metadata annotation and object-oriented data organization to a simple training dataset. OMERO offers centralized, secure access to data, allowing collaboration and reducing the data fragementation risk. Moreover, participants will experience the benefits of OME-Zarr, a chunked open file format designed for FAIR data sharing and remote access. OME-Zarr enables streaming of large, N-dimensional array-typed data over the Internet without the need to download whole files. An expanding toolbox for leveraging OME-Zarr for bioimaging data renders this file type a promising candidate for a standard file format suitable for use in FAIR Digital Object (FDO) implementations for microscopy data. OME-Zarr has become a pillar for imaging data sharing in two bioimaging-specific data repositories, i.e., the Image Data Resource (IDR) and the BioImage Archive (BIA). The team of Data Stewards from both abovenmentioned projects help researchers and research support staff to manage und publish bioimaging data.
By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained hands-on experience with bioimaging data and will be aware of support resources like the NFDI4BIOIMAGE Help Desk for addressing specific local use cases. Our goal is to promote collaboration across disciplines to effectively manage complex bioimaging data in compliance with the FAIR principles.

However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data, especially from high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms, present significant challenges. Managing and analysing this data efficiently requires well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR principles&mdash;ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable across different domains.
In the frame of NFDI4BioImaging (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing, analysing, and sharing HCS data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to make findable and machine-readable metadata using (semi)automatic analysis pipelines. In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity, supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata.
Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis. By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases the efficiency of HCS bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific community's efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation.
In the present study, we proposed an automated analysis pipeline for storing, processing, analysing, and sharing HCS bioimaging data. The (semi)automatic workflow was developed by taking as a case study a dataset of zebrafish larvae and cell lines images previously obtained from an automated imaging system generating data in an HCS fashion. In our workflows, images are automatically enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs, tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to the UFZ-OME Remote Objects (OMERO) server using a novel OMERO tool suite developed with GALAXY. Workflows give the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and perform image analysis (i.e. annotation) or even more complex toxicological analyses (dose response modelling). Furthermore, we want to improve the FAIRness of the protocol by adding a direct upload link to the Image Data Resource (IDR) repository to automatically prepare the data for publication and sharing.",Unknown,.pdf * .pptx,include in DALIA,en,,,,2025-02-25,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,66f41360-720b-48a5-98c0-d57a874da31f

Abstract
For over 20 years, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) has developed tools and specifications to support bioimaging data sharing. Technologies such as Bio-Formats, OMERO, and OME-TIFF have helped researchers manage the growing size, complexity, and acquisition rates of imaging datasets. However, with increasing mandates for research data management, such as the Nelson memo in the United States, and the shift toward cloud-native workflows, the bioimaging community faces new challenges in ensuring scalable and FAIR data infrastructure.
In 2024, following expanding community engagement, the focus of the Next-Generation File Format (NGFF) community was on building consensus around a Request for Comments (RFC) process. This collaborative effort has laid the foundation for future refinements and wider adoption. In parallel, we hosted the &ldquo;OME2024 NGFF Challenge,"" bringing together over the course of just four months hundreds of terabytes of data in a first prototype of federated image hosting, showcasing the power of OME-Zarr for handling large-scale, distributed datasets.
In 2025, we are set to take a major step toward a stable FAIR solution with OME-Zarr 1.0. This milestone marks a crucial phase towards an international standard, providing an open, cloud-optimized, and scalable solution for handling terabyte- and petabyte-scale imaging data. The 1.0 release will introduce long-awaited transforms, enabling robust support for multimodal datasets, followed by collections and an extensibility mechanism to accommodate evolving scientific needs. These additions emphasize a solid foundation on which future capabilities can be built while providing the stability needed for broader adoption of the format. This presentation will outline the path to 1.0, including community-driven refinements, vendor engagement to ensure complete metadata representation, and alignment with global bioimaging initiatives. As imaging data continues to grow in scale and complexity, consensus-driven evolution of infrastructure will be key to ensuring a truly FAIR future for bioimaging.

Abstract / Description
Bioimaging is a pervasive and indispensable methodological approach in the life and biomedical sciences. Due to the development of new technologies and the easier access to compute resources, bioimaging experiments have become a big data discipline, facing the same challenges as other omics technologies within the life sciences. However, to fully exploit the potential of bioimage data, it is necessary to make the data FAIR. In this webinar we will present viable solutions for storing, processing, analysing, and, first and foremost, sharing bioimaging data. We will introduce services provided to the scientific community, that are dealing with various aspects of the bioimage data life cycle such as:
- Where to get support for bioimage data management- Local bioimage data management: OMERO and beyond- Annotation of bioimage data: metadata, ontologies, REMBI etc- Linking your image data with experimental protocols and analysis results- Large data living in the cloud: ome.zarr- Publication of bioimage data
Who is this course for?
This webinar is suitable for marine biologists and environmental scientists collecting samples from the natural environment, generating, visualising, annotating and analysing large, multimodal datasets such as imaging data, and sharing their data by submitting them to public data repositories.

"Michele, Bortolomeazzi", CC-BY-4.0,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15771899,Accessible Interactive Spatial-Omics Data Visualizations with Vitessce and OMERO,,"OMERO is the most used research data management system (RDM) in the bioimaging domain, and has been adopted as a centralized RDM solution by several academic and research institutions. A main reason for this is the ability to directly view and annotate images from a web-based interface. However, this feature of OMERO is currently underpowered for the visualization of very large or multimodal datasets. These datasets, are becoming a more and more common foundation for biological and biomedical studies, due to the recent developments in imaging, and sequencing technologies which enabled their application to spatial-omics. In order to begin to provide this multimodal-data capability to OMERO, we developed omero-vitessce (https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/omero-vitessce/tree/main), a new OMERO.web plugin for viewing data stored in OMERO with the Vitessce (http://vitessce.io/) multimodal data viewer. omero-vitessce can be installed as an OMERO.web plugin with PiPy (https://pypi.org/project/omero-vitessce/), and allows users to set up interactive visualizations of their images of cells and tissues through interactive plots which are directly linked to the image. This enables the visual exploration of bioimage-analysis results and of multimodal data such as those generated through spatial-omics experiments. The data visualization is highly customizable and can be configured not only through custom configuration files, but also with the graphical interface provided by the plugin, thus making omero-vitessce a highly user-friendly solution for multimodal data viewing. most biological datasets. We plan to extend the interoperability of omero-vitessce with the OME-NGFF and SpatialData file formats to leverage the efficiency of these cloud optimized formats.",Unknown,.pptx,NFDI4Bioimage * OMERO * include in DALIA,en,,,,2025-06-30,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,e41f9a04-555e-42be-ae13-bc37f42da881

"Thönnißen, Julia * Oliveira, Sarah * Oberstrass, Alexander * Kropp, Jan-Oliver * Gui, Xiao * Schiffer, Christian * Dickscheid, Timo", CC-BY-4.0,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736220,A Perspective on FAIR and Scalable Access to Large Image Data,,"The rapid development of new imaging technologies across scientific domains–especially high-throughput technologies–results in a growing volume of image datasets in the Tera- to Petabyte scale. Efficient visualization and analysis of such massive image resources is critical but remains challenging due to the sheer size of the data, its continuous growth, and the limitations of conventional software tools to address these problems. Tools for visualization, annotation and analysis of large image data are confronted with the fundamental dilemma of balancing computational efficiency and memory requirements. Many tools are unable to process large datasets due to memory constraints, requiring workarounds like downsampling. On the other hand, solutions that can handle large data efficiently often rely on specialized or even proprietary file formats, limiting interoperability with other software. This reflects diverging requirements: storage favours compression for efficiency, analysis demands fast data access, and visualization requires tiled, multi-resolution representations. Lacking a unified approach for these conflicting needs, the operation of large and dynamically evolving image repositories in practice often requires undesirable data conversions and costly data duplication. In addressing these challenges, the bioimaging community increasingly adheres to the FAIR principles [1] through national and international initiatives [2], [3], [4]. For example, the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) fosters standards such as OME-TIFF [5] and its cloud-native successor OME-NGFF [6]; BioFormats [7] and OMERO [8] facilitate metadata-rich data handling across diverse platforms; and BrAinPI [9] provides web-based visualization of images via Neuroglancer [10]. These tools represent important developments towards more efficient and standardized use of bioimaging data. However, for very large and dynamically growing repositories, it is still not feasible to settle on a single standard for a subset of these tools, in particular in the light of very diverging needs for massively parallel processing on HPC systems. Therefore, converting data to a single target format is often not a practical solution. We propose a concept for a modular image delivery service which acts as a middleware between large image data resources and applications, serving image data from a cloud resource in multiple requested representations on demand. The service allows reading data stored in different input file formats, applying coordinate transformations and filtering operations on-the-fly, and serving the results in a range of different output formats and layouts. Building upon a common framework for reading and transforming data, an extensible set of access points connects the service to client applications: Lightweight REST APIs allow web-based mutli-resolution access (e.g., in common formats such as used in Neuroglancer and OpenSeadragon base viewers); mountable filesystem interfaces enable linking the repository to file-oriented solutions (e.g., OMERO, ImageJ); and programmatic access from customizable software tools (e.g., Napari). To provide compatibility with upcoming image data standards like BIDS [11] and minimize conversion efforts, the service is able to dynamically expose standard-conform views into arbitrarily organized datasets. The proposed approach for reading and transforming data on-the-fly eliminates the need for redundant storage and application-specific conversions of datasets, improving workflow efficiency and sustainability. In summary, we advocate for the development of a flexible and extensible image data service that supports large-scale analysis, dynamic transformations, multi-tool interoperability, and compatibility with community standards for large image datasets. This way it supports the FAIR principles, reduces integration barriers, meets the performance demands of modern imaging research, and still fosters the use of existing community developments.",Unknown,.pdf,include in DALIA,en,,,,2025-08-04,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2f736338-f8e4-413e-bf7a-d1b6f8cd23e8
