# Open data

Following FAIR data and open access principles, you can download the resources made accessible in this website, e.g. from our [github](https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/training) repository.

For user's convenience we created some automatically updated CSV exports of specific data:
* [training_materials.csv](training_materials.csv)
* [DALIA formatted training materials](DALIA_training_materials.csv)

[Get in touch](https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/training/issues/new) if you need other data exported as CSV files.
