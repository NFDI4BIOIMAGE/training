  description: 'Description

    Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing
    us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution.
    Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative
    information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files
    that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure,
    and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved
    between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with
    a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation.
    The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative
    results must be documented and reproducible.

    In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations
    in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their
    data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing
    and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts
    and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the
    principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance
    findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration
    of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained.
    Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to
    enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this
    workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:


    Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them

    Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis
    metadata

    The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation

    REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images

    Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining

    Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO


    The target group for this workshop

    This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started
    using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop
    participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata
    annotation for their everyday practice.
