  description: 'The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM)
    and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external
    experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented
    the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;

    Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions,
    data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management
    using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing
    and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in
    particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management
    software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit
    of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as
    open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities
    and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.

    Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle
    Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened
    the symposium were shared independently:

  description: Germany&rsquo;s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) aims to
    establish a sustained, cross-disciplinary research data management (RDM) infrastructure
    that enables researchers to handle FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
    reusable) data. While&nbsp;FAIR principles have been&nbsp;adopted by funders,
    policymakers, and publishers, their practical implementation remains an ongoing
    effort. In the field of bio-imaging, harmonization of&nbsp;data formats, metadata
    ontologies, and open data repositories is necessary&nbsp;to achieve FAIR data.&nbsp;The
    NFDI4BIOIMAGE was established&nbsp;to address these issues and&nbsp;develop tools
    and best practices to facilitate FAIR microscopy and image analysis data in alignment
    with international community activities. The&nbsp;consortium operates through
    its Data Stewards team to provide expertise and direct support to help overcome
    RDM challenges. The three Helmholtz Centers in NFDI4BIOIMAGE aim to collaborate
    closely with other centers and initiatives, such as HMC, Helmholtz AI, and HIP.

  description: 'Here we share the material used in a workshop held on May 13th, 2024,
    at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (on-premise)

    Description:Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional
    data, allowing us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal
    resolution. Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve
    quantitative information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of
    bioimaging files that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging
    to organize, structure, and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data
    often needs to be moved between collaboration partners, transformed into open
    formats, processed with a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized
    images for presentation. The path from image acquisition to final publication
    figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.

    In this workshop, participants learn how to use OMERO to organize their data and
    enrich the bioimage data with structured metadata annotations.We also focus on
    image analysis workflows in combination with OMERO based on the Fiji/ImageJ software
    and using Jupyter Notebooks. In the last part, we explore how OMERO can be used
    to create publication figures and prepare bioimage data for publication in a suitable
    repository such as the Bioimage Archive.

    Module 1&nbsp;(9 am - 10.15 am):&nbsp;Basics of OMERO, data structuring and annotation

    Module 2&nbsp;(10.45 am - 12.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Fiji

    Module 3&nbsp;(1.45 pm - 3.45 pm):&nbsp;OMERO and Jupyter Notebooks

    Module 4&nbsp;(4.15 pm - 6. pm):&nbsp;Publication-ready figures and data with
    OMERO

    The target group for this workshopThis workshop is directed at researchers at
    all career levels who plan to or have started to use OMERO for their microscopy
    research data management.&nbsp;We encourage the workshop participants to bring
    example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation for their
    everyday practice.

    Prerequisites:Users should bring their laptops and have access to the internet
    through one of the following options:- eduroam- institutional WiFi- VPN connection
    to their institutional networks to access OMERO

  description: 'In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However,
    just a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the
    development of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes
    it possible to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot
    immediately be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering
    the benefit of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

  description: Interdisciplinary collaboration and integration of large and diverse
    datasets are becoming increasingly important. Answering complex research questions
    requires combining and analysing multimodal datasets. Research data management
    follows the FAIR principles making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and
    reusable. However, there are challenges in capturing the entire research cycle
    and contextualizing data according, not only for the DataPLANT and NFDI4BIOIMAGE
    communities. To address these challenges, DataPLANT developed a data structure
    called Annotated Research Context (ARC). The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)
    originated from the neuroimaging community extended for microscopic image data.
    Both concepts provide standardised and file system based data storage structures
    for organising and sharing research data accompanied with metadata. We exemplarily
    compare the ARC and BIDS designs and propose structural and metadata mapping.

    issues across multiple domains. Interactively accessing terabyte-scale data has
    previously required significant server resources to properly prepare cropped or

    this burden has been adopted in the bioimaging domain for standardization. The

    Abstract:


    Research data management is essential in nowadays research, and one of the big
    opportunities to accelerate collaborative and innovative scientific projects.
    To achieve this goal, all our data needs to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
    reproducible). For data acquired on microscopes, however, a common ground for
    FAIR data sharing is still to be established. Plenty of work on file formats,
    data bases, and training needs to be performed to highlight the value of data
    sharing and exploit its potential for bioimaging data.


    In this presentation, Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters will introduce the challenges
    for bioimaging data management, and the necessary steps to achieve data FAIRification.
    German BioImaging - GMB e.V., together with other institutions, contributes to
    this endeavor. Janina Hanne will present how the network of imaging core facilities,
    research groups and industry partners is key to the German bioimaging community&rsquo;s
    aligned collaboration toward FAIR bioimaging data. These activities have paved
    the way for two data management initiatives in Germany: I3D:bio (Information Infrastructure
    for BioImage Data) and NFDI4BIOIMAGE, a consortium of the National Research Data
    Infrastructure. Christian Schmidt will introduce the goals and measures of these
    initiatives to the benefit of imaging scientist&rsquo;s work and everyday practice.
