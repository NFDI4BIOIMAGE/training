  description: 'Description

    Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing
    us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution.
    Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative
    information from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files
    that often come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure,
    and annotate bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved
    between collaboration partners, transformed into open formats, processed with
    a variety of software tools, and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation.
    The path from image acquisition to final publication figures with quantitative
    results must be documented and reproducible.

    In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations
    in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their
    data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing
    and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts
    and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the
    principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance
    findability and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration
    of OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained.
    Moreover, users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to
    enrich the value of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this
    workshop, we will provide hands-on training and recommendations on:


    Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them

    Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis
    metadata

    The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation

    REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images

    Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining

    Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO


    The target group for this workshop

    This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started
    using OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop
    participants to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata
    annotation for their everyday practice.

    Who are the trainers (see trainer description below for more details)


    Dr. Vanessa Fuchs (NFDI4BIOIMAGE Data Steward, Center for Advanced Imaging, Heinrich-Heine
    University of D&uuml;sseldorf)

  description: 'Within the project FDMentor, a German Train-the-Trainer Programme
    on Research Data Management (RDM) was developed and piloted in a series of workshops.
    The topics cover many aspects of research data management, such as data management
    plans and the publication of research data, as well as didactic units on learning
    concepts, workshop design and a range of didactic methods.


    After the end of the project, the concept was supplemented and updated by members
    of the Sub-Working Group Training/Further Education (UAG Schulungen/Fortbildungen)
    of the DINI/nestor Working Group Research Data (DINI/nestor-AG Forschungsdaten).
    The newly published English version of the Train-the-Trainer Concept contains
    the translated concept, the materials and all methods of the Train-the-Trainer
    Programme. Furthermore, additional English references and materials complement
    this version.'

  description: 'Researchers are increasingly often confronted with research data management
    (RDM) topics during their work. Higher education institutions therefore begin
    to offer services for RDM at some point to give support and advice. However, many
    groundbreaking decisions have to be made at the very beginning of RDM services.
    Priorities must be set and policies formulated. Likewise, the staff must first
    be qualified in order to provide advice and adequately deal with the manifold
    problems awaiting.

    The FDMentor project has therefore bundled the expertise of five German universities
    with different experiences and levels of RDM knowledge to jointly develop strategies,
    roadmaps, guidelines, and open access training material. Humboldt-Universit&auml;t
    zu Berlin, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin,
    University of Potsdam, and European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) have
    worked together on common solutions that are easy to adapt. With funding of the
    German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the collaborative project addressed
    four problem areas: strategy development, legal issues, policy development, and
    competence enhancement. The aim of the project outcomes is to provide other higher
    education institutions with the best possible support for the efficient introduction
    of research data management. Therefore, all project results are freely accessible
    under the CC-BY 4.0 international license. The early involvement of the community
    in the form of workshops and the collection of feedback has proven its worth:
    the FDMentor strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and training materials are applied
    and adapted beyond the partner universities.'

  description: The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management
    software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy
    data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management
    in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data
    (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management
    (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the
    adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training,
    a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using
    the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team,
    imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare
    additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based
    on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic)
    in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable,
    adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training
    lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners
    in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing
    the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

    with Python and visualize them with napari, an nD viewer open-source software.
    The analysis will be done in Python mostly using the scikit-image, pyclesperanto
    and apoc libraries, via Jupyter notebooks. We will also explore some napari plugins
    as an interactive and convenient alternative way of performing these analysis,
    especially the napari-assistant, napari-apoc and napari-flim-phasor-plotter plugins.

  description: 'The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM)
    and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external
    experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented
    the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;

    Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions,
    data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management
    using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing
    and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in
    particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management
    software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit
    of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as
    open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities
    and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.

    Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle
    Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened
    the symposium were shared independently:

    The workshop organization was funded by the CMCB/PoL Networking Grant and supported
    by the consortium NFDI4BIOIMAGE (funded by DFG grant number NFDI 46/1, project
    number 501864659).'

  description: In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However, just
    a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the development
    of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes it possible
    to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot immediately
    be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering the benefit
    of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

  description: Open source software (OSS) is essential for advancing scientific discovery,
    particularly in biomedical research, yet funding to support these vital tools
    has been limited. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software
    for Science (EOSS) program has significantly contributed to this field by providing
    $51.8 million in funding over five years to support the maintenance, growth, and
    community engagement of critical OSS tools. The program has impacted scientific
    OSS projects by improving their technical outputs, community building, and sustainability
    practices, and fostering collaborations within the OSS community. Additionally,
    EOSS funding has enhanced diversity, equity, and inclusion within the OSS community,
    although changes in principal investigator demographics were not observed. The
    funded projects have had a substantial impact on biomedical research by improving
    the usability and accessibility of scientific software, which has led to increased
    adoption and advancements in various biomedical fields.

    NFDI4BIOIMAGE is a newly established German consortium dedicated to the FAIR representation
    of biological imaging data. A key deliverable is the definition of a semantically-compatible
    FAIR image object integrating RDF metadata with web-compatible storage of large
    n-dimensional binary data in OME-Zarr. We invite feedback from and collaboration
    with other endeavors during the soon-to-begin 5 year funding period.

  description: 'Bioimaging refers to a collection of methods to visualize the internal
    structures and mechanisms of living organisms. The fundamental tool, the microscope,
    has enabled seminal discoveries like that of the cell as the smallest unit of
    life, and continues to expand our understanding of biological processes. Today,
    we can follow the interaction of single molecules within nanoseconds in a living
    cell, and the development of complete small organisms like fish and flies over
    several days starting from the fertilized egg. Each image pixel encodes multiple
    spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions, compounding the massive volume and complexity
    of bioimage data. Proper handling of this data is indispensable for analysis and
    its lack has become a growing hindrance for the many disciplines of the life and
    biomedical sciences relying on bioimaging. No single domain has the expertise
    to tackle this bottleneck alone.

    As a method-specific consortium, NFDI4BIOMAGE seeks to address these issues, enabling
    bioimaging data to be shared and re-used like they are acquired, i.e., independently
    of disciplinary boundaries. We will provide solutions for exploiting the full
    information content of bioimage data and enable new discoveries through sharing
    and re-analysis. Our RDM strategy is based on a robust needs analysis that derives
    not only from a community survey but also from over a decade of experience in
    German BioImaging, the German Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis. It considers
    the entire lifecycle of bioimaging data, from acquisition to archiving, including
    analysis and enabling re-use. A foundational element of this strategy is the definition
    of a common, cloud-compatible, and interoperable digital object that bundles binary
    images with their descriptive and provenance metadata. With members from plant
    biology to neuroscience, NFDI4BIOIMAGE will champion the standardization of bioimage
    data to create a framework that answers discipline-specific needs while ensuring
    communication and interoperability with data types and RDM systems across domains.
    Integration of bioimage data with, e.g., omics data as the basis for spatial omics,
    holds great promise for fields such as cancer medicine. Unlocking the full potential
    of bioimage data will rely on the development and broad availability of exceptional
    analysis tools and training sets. NFDI4BIOIMAGE will make these accessible and
    usable including cutting-edge AI-based methods in scalable cloud environments.
    NFDI4BIOIMAGE intersects with multiple NFDI consortia, most prominently with GHGA
    for linking image and genomics data and with DataPLANT on the definition of FAIR
    data objects. Last but not least, NFDI4BIOIMAGE is internationally well connected
    and represents the opportunity for German scientists to keep path with and have
    a voice in several international initiatives focusing on the FAIRification of
    bioimage data as one of the main challenges for the advancement of knowledge in
    the life and biomedical sciences.'

  description: 'The DALIA (Data Literacy Alliance) project aims to develop a knowledge
    graph for FAIR teaching and learning materials on data literacy, data competencies
    and research data management (RDM) skills within the National Research Data Infrastructure
    (NFDI) and the RDM landscape. Such a platform thrives on the participation of
    users who want to search, create, manage or use teaching and learning materials.

    A schematization of the metadata is necessary for the interoperability of teaching
    and learning materials. This is done by the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF), which
    provides a framework for making the metadata of teaching and learning materials
    transparent, comparable and smooth to integrate into the DALIA platform. It includes
    the description and explanation of the data fields for the online publication
    of educational resources.

    The DIF was developed in close consultation with the scientific community. This
    development process included several feedback rounds in which valuable feedback
    was provided and subsequently incorporated into the DIF. This not only contributed
    to the clear, transparent and user-oriented definitions of the data fields, and
    to a clear structure, but also to the integration of many existing data standards
    and to the (special) requirements of the scientific community. The selection of
    elements is based on the&nbsp;Dublin Core Application Profile.

    The DIF is provided as a PDF document and in table form (ODS) to convey the attributes
    of the teaching and learning materials and their definitions in an easily understandable
    form and to facilitate communication. It also includes a legend and an example
    in tabular form. In addition, a template (CSV) with the attributes as column headers
    is provided, which can be used for recording the metadata of the teaching and
    learning materials. The tables can also be transferred to technical application
    profiles.

    We would like to thank all the commentators of the previous versions, especially
    Susanne Arndt, Sophie Bo&szlig;e, Sonja Felder, Marc Fuhrmans, Jan-Michael Haugwitz,
    Marina Lemaire, Karoline Lemke, Birte Lindst&auml;dt, Juliane R&ouml;der, and
    Jakob Vo&szlig;. Without their feedback and advice, the DIF would be less transparent.'

  description: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way how humans interact
    with computers. This has impact on all scientific fields by enabling new ways
    to achieve for example data analysis goals. In this talk we will go through an
    introduction to LLMs with respect to applications in the life sciences, focusing
    on bio-image analysis. We will see how to generate text and images using LLMs
    and how LLMs can extract information from reproducibly images through code-generation.
    We will go through selected prompt engineering techniques enabling scientists
    to tune the output of LLMs towards their scientific goal and how to do quality
    assurance in this context.
