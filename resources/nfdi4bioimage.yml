  description: 'Within the project FDMentor, a German Train-the-Trainer Programme
    on Research Data Management (RDM) was developed and piloted in a series of workshops.
    The topics cover many aspects of research data management, such as data management
    plans and the publication of research data, as well as didactic units on learning
    concepts, workshop design and a range of didactic methods.


    After the end of the project, the concept was supplemented and updated by members
    of the Sub-Working Group Training/Further Education (UAG Schulungen/Fortbildungen)
    of the DINI/nestor Working Group Research Data (DINI/nestor-AG Forschungsdaten).
    The newly published English version of the Train-the-Trainer Concept contains
    the translated concept, the materials and all methods of the Train-the-Trainer
    Programme. Furthermore, additional English references and materials complement
    this version.'

  description: 'Researchers are increasingly often confronted with research data management
    (RDM) topics during their work. Higher education institutions therefore begin
    to offer services for RDM at some point to give support and advice. However, many
    groundbreaking decisions have to be made at the very beginning of RDM services.
    Priorities must be set and policies formulated. Likewise, the staff must first
    be qualified in order to provide advice and adequately deal with the manifold
    problems awaiting.

    The FDMentor project has therefore bundled the expertise of five German universities
    with different experiences and levels of RDM knowledge to jointly develop strategies,
    roadmaps, guidelines, and open access training material. Humboldt-Universit&auml;t
    zu Berlin, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Technische Universit&auml;t Berlin,
    University of Potsdam, and European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) have
    worked together on common solutions that are easy to adapt. With funding of the
    German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the collaborative project addressed
    four problem areas: strategy development, legal issues, policy development, and
    competence enhancement. The aim of the project outcomes is to provide other higher
    education institutions with the best possible support for the efficient introduction
    of research data management. Therefore, all project results are freely accessible
    under the CC-BY 4.0 international license. The early involvement of the community
    in the form of workshops and the collection of feedback has proven its worth:
    the FDMentor strategies, roadmaps, guidelines, and training materials are applied
    and adapted beyond the partner universities.'

  description: The open-source software OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a data management
    software that allows storing, organizing, and annotating bioimaging/microscopy
    data. OMERO has become one of the best-known systems for bioimage data management
    in the bioimaging community. The Information Infrastructure for BioImage Data
    (I3D:bio) project facilitates the uptake of OMERO into research data management
    (RDM) practices at universities and research institutions in Germany. Since the
    adoption of OMERO into researchers' daily routines requires intensive training,
    a broad portfolio of training resources for OMERO is an asset. On top of using
    the OMERO guides curated by the Open Microscopy Environment Consortium (OME) team,
    imaging core facility staff at institutions where OMERO is used often prepare
    additional material tailored to be applicable for their own OMERO instances. Based
    on experience gathered in the Research Data Management for Microscopy group (RDM4mic)
    in Germany, and in the use cases in the I3D:bio project, we created a set of reusable,
    adjustable, openly available slide decks to serve as the basis for tailored training
    lectures, video tutorials, and self-guided instruction manuals directed at beginners
    in using OMERO. The material is published as an open educational resource complementing
    the existing resources for OMERO contributed by the community.

    with Python and visualize them with napari, an nD viewer open-source software.
    The analysis will be done in Python mostly using the scikit-image, pyclesperanto
    and apoc libraries, via Jupyter notebooks. We will also explore some napari plugins
    as an interactive and convenient alternative way of performing these analysis,
    especially the napari-assistant, napari-apoc and napari-flim-phasor-plotter plugins.

  description: 'The workshop introduced key topics of research data management (RDM)
    and the implementation thereof on a life science campus. Internal and external
    experts of RDM including scientists that apply chosen software tools presented
    the basic concepts and their implementation to a broad audience.&nbsp;

    Talks covered general aspects of data handling and sorting, naming conventions,
    data storage repositories and archives, licensing of material, data and code management
    using git, data protection particularly regarding patient data and in genome sequencing
    and more. Two data management concepts and exemplary tools were highlighted in
    particular, being electronic lab notebooks with eLabFTW and the bio-image management
    software OMERO. Those were chosen because of three aspects: the large benefit
    of these management tools for a life science campus, their free availability as
    open source tools with the option of contribution of required functionalities
    and first existing use cases on campus already supported by CMCB/PoL IT.

    Two talks by Robert Haase (ScaDS.AI/ Uni Leipzig) and Robert M&uuml;ller (Kontaktstelle
    Forschungsdaten, TU Dresden with contributions from Denise D&ouml;rfel) that opened
    the symposium were shared independently:

  description: In 2005, the first version of OMERO stored RDF natively. However, just
    a year after the 1.0 release of RDF, performance considerations led to the development
    of a more traditional SQL approach for OMERO. A binary protocol makes it possible
    to query and retrieve metadata but the resulting information cannot immediately
    be combined with other sources. This is the adventure of rediscovering the benefit
    of RDF triples as a -- if not the -- common exchange mechanism.

  description: Interdisciplinary collaboration and integrating large, diverse datasets
    are crucial for answering complex research questions, requiring multimodal data
    analysis and adherence to FAIR principles. To address challenges in capturing
    the full research cycle and contextualizing data, DataPLANT developed the Annotated
    Research Context (ARC), while the neuroimaging community extended the Brain Imaging
    Data Structure (BIDS) for microscopic image data, both providing standardized,
    file system-based storage structures for organizing and sharing data with metadata.

  description: In this SaxFDM Digital Kitchen, I introduced current challenges and
    potential solutions for openly sharing training materials, softly focusing on
    bio-image analysis. In this field a lot of training materials circulate in private
    channels, but openly shared, reusable materials, according to the FAIR-principles,
    are still rare. Using the CC-BY license and uploading materials to publicly acessible
    repositories are proposed to fill this gap.

  description: Open source software (OSS) is essential for advancing scientific discovery,
    particularly in biomedical research, yet funding to support these vital tools
    has been limited. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Source Software
    for Science (EOSS) program has significantly contributed to this field by providing
    $51.8 million in funding over five years to support the maintenance, growth, and
    community engagement of critical OSS tools. The program has impacted scientific
    OSS projects by improving their technical outputs, community building, and sustainability
    practices, and fostering collaborations within the OSS community. Additionally,
    EOSS funding has enhanced diversity, equity, and inclusion within the OSS community,
    although changes in principal investigator demographics were not observed. The
    funded projects have had a substantial impact on biomedical research by improving
    the usability and accessibility of scientific software, which has led to increased
    adoption and advancements in various biomedical fields.

    NFDI4BIOIMAGE is a newly established German consortium dedicated to the FAIR representation
    of biological imaging data. A key deliverable is the definition of a semantically-compatible
    FAIR image object integrating RDF metadata with web-compatible storage of large
    n-dimensional binary data in OME-Zarr. We invite feedback from and collaboration
    with other endeavors during the soon-to-begin 5 year funding period.

  description: 'Bioimaging refers to a collection of methods to visualize the internal
    structures and mechanisms of living organisms. The fundamental tool, the microscope,
    has enabled seminal discoveries like that of the cell as the smallest unit of
    life, and continues to expand our understanding of biological processes. Today,
    we can follow the interaction of single molecules within nanoseconds in a living
    cell, and the development of complete small organisms like fish and flies over
    several days starting from the fertilized egg. Each image pixel encodes multiple
    spatiotemporal and spectral dimensions, compounding the massive volume and complexity
    of bioimage data. Proper handling of this data is indispensable for analysis and
    its lack has become a growing hindrance for the many disciplines of the life and
    biomedical sciences relying on bioimaging. No single domain has the expertise
    to tackle this bottleneck alone.

    As a method-specific consortium, NFDI4BIOMAGE seeks to address these issues, enabling
    bioimaging data to be shared and re-used like they are acquired, i.e., independently
    of disciplinary boundaries. We will provide solutions for exploiting the full
    information content of bioimage data and enable new discoveries through sharing
    and re-analysis. Our RDM strategy is based on a robust needs analysis that derives
    not only from a community survey but also from over a decade of experience in
    German BioImaging, the German Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis. It considers
    the entire lifecycle of bioimaging data, from acquisition to archiving, including
    analysis and enabling re-use. A foundational element of this strategy is the definition
    of a common, cloud-compatible, and interoperable digital object that bundles binary
    images with their descriptive and provenance metadata. With members from plant
    biology to neuroscience, NFDI4BIOIMAGE will champion the standardization of bioimage
    data to create a framework that answers discipline-specific needs while ensuring
    communication and interoperability with data types and RDM systems across domains.
    Integration of bioimage data with, e.g., omics data as the basis for spatial omics,
    holds great promise for fields such as cancer medicine. Unlocking the full potential
    of bioimage data will rely on the development and broad availability of exceptional
    analysis tools and training sets. NFDI4BIOIMAGE will make these accessible and
    usable including cutting-edge AI-based methods in scalable cloud environments.
    NFDI4BIOIMAGE intersects with multiple NFDI consortia, most prominently with GHGA
    for linking image and genomics data and with DataPLANT on the definition of FAIR
    data objects. Last but not least, NFDI4BIOIMAGE is internationally well connected
    and represents the opportunity for German scientists to keep path with and have
    a voice in several international initiatives focusing on the FAIRification of
    bioimage data as one of the main challenges for the advancement of knowledge in
    the life and biomedical sciences.'

  description: 'The DALIA (Data Literacy Alliance) project aims to develop a knowledge
    graph for FAIR teaching and learning materials on data literacy, data competencies
    and research data management (RDM) skills within the National Research Data Infrastructure
    (NFDI) and the RDM landscape. Such a platform thrives on the participation of
    users who want to search, create, manage or use teaching and learning materials.

    A schematization of the metadata is necessary for the interoperability of teaching
    and learning materials. This is done by the DALIA Interchange Format (DIF), which
    provides a framework for making the metadata of teaching and learning materials
    transparent, comparable and smooth to integrate into the DALIA platform. It includes
    the description and explanation of the data fields for the online publication
    of educational resources.

    The DIF was developed in close consultation with the scientific community. This
    development process included several feedback rounds in which valuable feedback
    was provided and subsequently incorporated into the DIF. This not only contributed
    to the clear, transparent and user-oriented definitions of the data fields, and
    to a clear structure, but also to the integration of many existing data standards
    and to the (special) requirements of the scientific community. The selection of
    elements is based on the&nbsp;Dublin Core Application Profile.

    The DIF is provided as a PDF document and in table form (ODS) to convey the attributes
    of the teaching and learning materials and their definitions in an easily understandable
    form and to facilitate communication. It also includes a legend and an example
    in tabular form. In addition, a template (CSV) with the attributes as column headers
    is provided, which can be used for recording the metadata of the teaching and
    learning materials. The tables can also be transferred to technical application
    profiles.

    We would like to thank all the commentators of the previous versions, especially
    Susanne Arndt, Sophie Bo&szlig;e, Sonja Felder, Marc Fuhrmans, Jan-Michael Haugwitz,
    Marina Lemaire, Karoline Lemke, Birte Lindst&auml;dt, Juliane R&ouml;der, and
    Jakob Vo&szlig;. Without their feedback and advice, the DIF would be less transparent.'

  description: Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way how humans interact
    with computers. This has impact on all scientific fields by enabling new ways
    to achieve for example data analysis goals. In this talk we will go through an
    introduction to LLMs with respect to applications in the life sciences, focusing
    on bio-image analysis. We will see how to generate text and images using LLMs
    and how LLMs can extract information from reproducibly images through code-generation.
    We will go through selected prompt engineering techniques enabling scientists
    to tune the output of LLMs towards their scientific goal and how to do quality
    assurance in this context.

  description: This book is a companion to the Nature Methods publication Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses. In this paper, members of QUAREP-LiMi have proposed 3 sets of standards for publishing image figures and image analysis - minimal requirements, recommended additions, and ideal comprehensive goals. By following this guidance, we hope to remove some of the stress non-experts may face in determining what they need to do, and we also believe that researchers will find their science more interpretable and more reproducible.

  description: 'Description
  
    Microscopy experiments generate information-rich, multi-dimensional data, allowing
    us to investigate biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution.
    Image processing and analysis is a standard procedure to retrieve quantitative information
    from biological imaging. Due to the complex nature of bioimaging files that often
    come in proprietary formats, it can be challenging to organize, structure, and annotate
    bioimaging data throughout a project. Data often needs to be moved between collaboration
    partners, transformed into open formats, processed with a variety of software tools,
    and exported to smaller-sized images for presentation. The path from image acquisition
    to final publication figures with quantitative results must be documented and reproducible.
  
    In this workshop, participants learn how to use structured metadata annotations
    in the image data management platform OMERO (OME Remote Objects) to optimize their
    data handling. This strategy helps both with organizing data for easier processing
    and analysis and for the preparation of data publication in journal manuscripts
    and in public repositories such as the BioImage Archive. Participants learn the
    principles of leveraging object-oriented data organization in OMERO to enhance findability
    and usability of their data, also in collaborative settings. The integration of
    OMERO with image analysis tools, in particular ImageJ/Fiji, will be trained. Moreover,
    users learn about community-accepted metadata checklists (REMBI) to enrich the value
    of their data toward reproducibility and reusability. In this workshop, we will
    provide hands-on training and recommendations on:
  
  
    Structured metadata annotation features in OMERO and how to use them
  
    Types of metadata in bioimaging: Technical metadata, sample metadata, analysis metadata
  
    The use of ontologies and terminologies for metadata annotation
  
    REMBI, the recommended metadata for biological images
  
    Metadata-assisted image analysis streamlining
  
    Tools for metadata annotation in OMERO
  
  
    The target group for this workshop
  
    This workshop is directed at researchers at all career levels who have started using
    OMERO for their microscopy research data management. We encourage the workshop participants
    to bring example data from their research to discuss suitable metadata annotation
    for their everyday practice.

  description: The authors have developed a model for scientific metadata, and they have made that model usable by both CEDAR and FAIRware. The approach shows that a formal metadata model can standardize reporting guidelines and that it can enable separate software systems to assist (1) in the authoring of standards-adherent metadata and (2) in the evaluation of existing metadata.

  description: Die Digitalisierung ermöglicht eine offene Wissenschaft (Open Science). Diese hat viele Aspekte, insbesondere den freien Zugang zu wissenschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen und Materialien (Open Access), transparente Begutachtungsverfahren (Open Peer Review) oder quelloffene Technologien (Open Source). Das Programm Hamburg Open Science (Laufzeit 2018–2020) unterstützt unter anderem den Kulturwandel in der Wissenschaft. In diesem Kontext entstand der nun vorliegende Leitfaden, der das rechtliche Umfeld greifbar machen soll. Der Leitfaden erarbeitet die betroffenen Rechtsgebiete zunächst systematisch. Im zweiten Teil werden rechtliche Fragen zu Open Science beantwortet, die direkt aus den Universitäten und Bibliotheken kommen.

  description: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific research
    presents both opportunities and challenges for life scientists. Key challenges include
    ensuring transparency in AI-generated content and facilitating efficient knowledge
    exchange among researchers. These issues arise from the in-transparent nature of
    AI-driven code generation and the informal sharing of AI insights, which may hinder
    reproducibility and collaboration. This paper introduces git-bob, an innovative
    AI-assistant designed to address these challenges by fostering an interactive and
    transparent collaboration platform within GitHub. By enabling seamless dialogue
    between humans and AI, git-bob ensures that AI contributions are transparent and
    reproducible. Moreover, it supports collaborative knowledge exchange, enhancing
    the interdisciplinary dialogue necessary for cutting-edge life sciences research.
    The open-source nature of git-bob further promotes accessibility and customization,
    positioning it as a vital tool in employing LLMs responsibly and effectively within
    scientific communities.

  description: Bioimaging has transformed our understanding of biological processes,
    yet extracting&nbsp;meaningful information from complex datasets remains a challenge,
    particularly for&nbsp;early career scientists. This paper proposes a simplified,
    systematic approach to&nbsp;bioimage analysis, focusing on categorizing commonly
    observed structures and&nbsp;shapes, and providing relevant analysis methods. Our
    approach includes illustrative&nbsp;examples and a visual flowchart, enabling researchers
    to define analysis objectives&nbsp;clearly. By understanding the diversity of bioimage
    structures and aligning them with&nbsp;appropriate analysis approaches, the framework
    empowers researchers to navigate&nbsp;bioimage datasets more efficiently. It also
    aims to foster a common language between&nbsp;researchers and analysts, thereby
    enhancing mutual understanding and facilitating&nbsp;effective communication.

  description: 'Imaging is crucial across various scientific disciplines, particularly
    in life sciences, where it plays a key role in studies ranging from single molecules
    to whole organisms. However, the complexity and sheer volume of image data, especially
    from high-content screening (HCS) experiments involving cell lines or other organisms,
    present significant challenges. Managing and analysing this data efficiently requires
    well-defined image processing tools and analysis pipelines that align with the FAIR
    principles&mdash;ensuring they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
    across different domains.
  
    In the frame of NFDI4BioImaging (the National Research Data Infrastructure focusing
    on bioimaging in Germany), we want to find viable solutions for storing, processing,
    analysing, and sharing HCS data. In particular, we want to develop solutions to
    make findable and machine-readable metadata using (semi)automatic analysis pipelines.
    In scientific research, such pipelines are crucial for maintaining data integrity,
    supporting reproducibility, and enabling interdisciplinary collaboration. These
    tools can be used by different users to retrieve images based on specific attributes
    as well as support quality control by identifying appropriate metadata.
  
    Galaxy, an open-source, web-based platform for data-intensive research, offers a
    solution by enabling the construction of reproducible pipelines for image analysis.
    By integrating popular analysis software like CellProfiler and connecting with cloud
    services such as OMERO and IDR, Galaxy facilitates the seamless access and management
    of image data. This capability is particularly valuable in bioimaging, where automated
    pipelines can streamline the handling of complex metadata, ensuring data integrity
    and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. This approach not only increases
    the efficiency of HCS bioimaging but also contributes to the broader scientific
    community''s efforts to embrace FAIR principles, ultimately advancing scientific
    discovery and innovation.
  
    In the present study, we proposed an automated analysis pipeline for storing, processing,
    analysing, and sharing HCS bioimaging data. The (semi)automatic workflow was developed
    by taking as a case study a dataset of zebrafish larvae and cell lines images previously
    obtained from an automated imaging system generating data in an HCS fashion. In
    our workflows, images are automatically enriched with metadata (i.e. key-value pairs,
    tags, raw data, regions of interest) and uploaded to the UFZ-OME Remote Objects
    (OMERO) server using a novel OMERO tool suite developed with GALAXY. Workflows give
    the possibility to the user to intuitively fetch images from the local server and
    perform image analysis (i.e. annotation) or even more complex toxicological analyses
    (dose response modelling). Furthermore, we want to improve the FAIRness of the protocol
    by adding a direct upload link to the Image Data Resource (IDR) repository to automatically
    prepare the data for publication and sharing.'

  description: 'Fit for OMERO: How imaging facilities and IT departments work together
    to enable RDM for bioimaging
  
    Description:
  
    Research data management (RDM) in bioimaging is challenging because of large file
    sizes, heterogeneous file formats and the variability of imaging methods. The image
    data management system OMERO (OME Remote Objects) allows for centralized and secure
    storage, organization, annotation, and interrogation of microscopy data by researchers.
    It is an internationally well-supported open-source software tool that has become
    one of the best-known image data management tools among bioimaging scientists. Nevertheless,
    the&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;setup of OMERO at an institute is a multi-stakeholder process
    that demands time, funds, organization and iterative implementation. In this workshop,
    participants learn how to begin setting up OMERO-based image data management at
    their institution. The topics include:
  
  
    Stakeholder identification at the university / research institute
  
    Process management, time line expectations, and resources planning
  
    Learning about each other&lsquo;s perspectives on chances and challenges for RDM
  
    Funding opportunities and strategies for IT and imaging core facilities
  
    Hands-on: Setting up an OMERO server in a virtual machine environment
  
  
    Target audience:
  
    This workshop was directed at universities and research institutions who consider
    or plan to implement OMERO, or are in an early phase of implementation. This workshop
    was intended for teams from IT departments and imaging facilities to participate
    together with one person from the IT department, and one person from the imaging
    core facility at the same institution.
  
    The trainers:
  
  
    Prof. Dr. Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (Imaging Core Facility Head, Center for Advanced
    Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
  
    Dr. Susanne Kunis (Software architect, OMERO administrator, metadata specialist,
    University of Osnabr&uuml;ck)
  
    Dr. Tom Boissonnet (OMERO admin and image metadata specialist, Center for Advanced
    Imaging, Heinrich Heine University of D&uuml;sseldorf)
  
    Dr. Bettina Hagen&nbsp;(IT Administration and service specialist, Max Planck Institute
    for the Biology of Ageing, Cologne)&nbsp;
  
    Dr. Christian Schmidt (Science Manager for Research Data Management in Bioimaging,
    German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg)
  
  
    Time and place
  
    The format was a two-day, in-person workshop (October 16-17, 2024).&nbsp;Location:
